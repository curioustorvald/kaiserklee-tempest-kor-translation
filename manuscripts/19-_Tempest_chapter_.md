**Chapter 19: Crystals Glitter Upon the Mundane**

Now that the first of the nightmares resurfaced, Elsa was plagued with them every night. Even though Elsa tried to assure her it was no fault of hers, Anna couldn't help but feel guilty. She was the one dragging up all these foreign emotions, and with them, the pain Elsa had done so much to repress. Not that she agreed with the repressing, but every time Anna looked across her bed to see Elsa writhing in her sleep, gasping unintelligible words that spoke of little more than absolute, paralyzing fear…

She wished more than anything that she could be the one suffering instead.

No matter how hard Elsa tried to drown herself in work, the nightmares never abated but instead seemed worse than before. They were strong enough that sometimes Anna would get glimpses of them, even while she was awake. Memories of Elsa's childhood, some good and some bad, intermingled into a chaotic swirl of resentment and regret and longing. Sometimes she would feel herself shatter into thousands of pieces and scatter into the wind, power broken, but Anna did not understand these sensations and Elsa was just as puzzled. The scenes of Elsa carving out her heart into a reliquary slipped in among them, and Elsa would wake clutching her chest gasping for air she no longer needed.

Elsa told her not to fret over her nightmares, but Anna made it a point to walk over to Elsa's bed every time, until it became a regular occurrence for her to wake up to Anna holding her protectively in her arms. She would find her head lying on Anna's shoulder, forehead against her neck, lulled to sleep by the gentle pulse of her heartbeat. All too often, Elsa opened her eyes to see Anna sitting against the headboard with her head in her lap, one hand brushing through her hair.

One night, Anna simply joined Elsa in her bed.

They would wake up together anyway, Anna reasoned, knowing Elsa was wary of the idea. Something about decency, but Anna argued that it was more efficient to just share one bed. Elsa was _all_ about efficiency. Eventually, just as Anna began to run out of arguments, Elsa nodded and held her close.

It was another morning of Anna staying up through the night with Elsa's head in her lap. Another night of Elsa suffering through the feeling of loss, but Anna was glad to see her sleeping peacefully at last. When Elsa woke up, her slow blinking and languid stretch reminiscent of a cat, Anna smiled brightly in greeting. Elsa sat up and Anna shifted as well, moving off the hard backboard she had been leaning against the entire night. When Anna stretched, her joints cracked one after the other.

"You shouldn't sleep like that," Elsa said. "It's bad for your back."

"Oh, probably," Anna chirped. "But if it helps you sleep better, I don't mind."

"You're losing sleep."

Anna only shrugged noncommittally, prompting a sigh from the queen. She was losing a little sleep, sure, but Elsa had admitted to having run on an hour of sleep a night – _on average_ – for an undisclosed amount of time. But Anna could guess exactly how long that habit had lasted. Elsa hadn't needed as much sleep ever since making her reliquary, and she had abused that privilege ever since…five years ago. Anna could stand to lose some sleep in comparison.

When Anna turned to hop off the bed, Elsa caught her wrist and said, very calmly, in the blandest of deadpans, "Take off your shirt."

Anna whirled around and gave her an odd stare. "Uhh, I'm not sure I follow. Is this a good surprise? It's just a little random, I mean."

Elsa frowned. "Just listen to me. Take off your shirt and lay down on your front."

It was a strange request all things considered, but Anna trusted Elsa enough to not ask questions, instead doing exactly as she asked without further hesitation. Without _any_ hesitation. Elsa politely averted her eyes when Anna undressed without even bothering to turn away, and Anna fought back giggles at her obvious discomfort. It took effort to get Elsa worked up enough to abandon _decency_, as she called it. Most the time, she was perfectly courteous to the point of being stuffy.

As soon as Anna flopped down on her stomach, Elsa sat up and swung her knee over Anna's prone form so she straddled her lower back. She wasn't exactly wearing a whole lot of fabric herself, so the inside of her bare thighs were pressing into Anna's sides. Anna wriggled at the strange sensation, feeling laughter build up in her stomach as she tried desperately to get away. She was ticklish!

"Stay still and try to relax," Elsa murmured, but she seriously had no idea what she was doing, leaning down so her breath fanned over the shell of Anna's ear. Anna was ready to die.

Just as Anna considered doing something _really_ indecent to escape, Elsa placed her hands on either side of her spine, fingers rubbing the aching muscles in her back. Anna buried her face in a pillow trying to hide how red she was, but the moment she breathed deeply and smelled Elsa's scent, she arched her back and moaned aloud.

Elsa paused.

"J-Just keep doing what you're doing," Anna said. She had wanted to get away only a few seconds ago, but now the thought of Elsa getting off of her was almost unthinkable. So she was half-naked with Elsa on top of her giving her a back massage. Not the strangest thing in the world.

Anna felt Elsa lean forward and work light circles on her skin, languidly making her way up before beginning to knead her shoulders with a firm but gentle touch. Delicious warmth spread through her body as Elsa's hands worked over her back; Anna moaned into the pillow again as the tension gradually left her strained muscles. As always Elsa emanated a comfortable chill, but Anna felt something more like a pleasant fire tracing alongside her spine. She thought she might start melting any minute from the heat enveloping her skin.

"You really do have freckles everywhere," Elsa murmured. "I never noticed before."

If it were possible, Anna thought she really might combust into flames. She couldn't even work up a decent response, instead biting back a low groan when Elsa clamped her thighs around her just a little bit tighter for better leverage. Those cold fingers spread across her back farther and farther away from the center, flirting dangerously close to the sides of her naked breasts. Before Elsa actually touched her there, she moved up and dug into her shoulders, and it felt wonderful even if Anna wanted to scream at the tease.

When Elsa started on her neck, leaning down to work out the knots, Anna gave up at trying to stay calm. She flipped around, cupped Elsa's face, and kissed her with all the force she could muster, thrusting her tongue into her mouth. She was probably moving much too quickly but she _needed_ to get close, as close as possible. Elsa had the nerve to seem _surprised_, like she really had no idea what she was doing to her; Anna growled and pushed forward, trapping Elsa under herself. She bent down and spent a moment licking and biting at Elsa's collarbone, feeling Elsa raise a leg and lock it around her waist to drag her closer.

"You are so dense," Anna said, pressing kisses all along the pale skin of her neck and looking up to enjoy the sight of Elsa with her eyes closed, lips slightly parted.

"…You seem to like it." Without warning, Elsa reached up to pull Anna to the side and down, smiling at her stunned gape before pressing a chaste kiss to her forehead. "But maybe some other time, Anna. Should we…?"

Anna pouted. "You get me half-naked and then ask me to stop. That's not fair." Elsa only sat back and gave her another small smile, and Anna knew she wasn't going to win. Swallowing back another retort and desperately trying to calm herself down, she flopped back around to her front. "All right, all right."

"Are you ready?" Elsa asked.

That was supposed to be _her_ question, but Anna nodded her head anyway. She had absolutely no concern about this, but it had taken several days of careful coaxing and needling before Elsa finally agreed. That she had brought it up herself was practically proof that she was more flustered than she let on, and Anna silently celebrated her victory. At least _one_ good thing had come of her being teased.

Elsa would be making her another dress.

Only this time, Elsa would be making it from nothing. No template dress for her to build off of, nothing in between her magic and Anna. There was only Elsa this time.

Anna felt Elsa summon her magic, the burst of cold air like a breeze against her bare skin, and even if she was looking away, Anna could imagine the sparkling mixture of ice and snow swirling around her fingertips. Slowly, carefully, Elsa lowered her hand and clasped Anna's in her own.

It was almost as good as the kisses, honestly. Anna felt a shiver wrack through her spine as the ice flowed over her like a second skin, gently melding itself over her body with a soft touch more intimate than that of a lover. She squeezed her eyes shut, but her lack of vision only made the sensation even more powerful. It was a slow burn, almost painful in the intensity of its pleasure, and Anna clutched Elsa's hand hard, hard enough she would have worried she was hurting her if she could form any coherent thought.

All too soon, it was over. Anna slowly opened her eyes, feeling the world spin on its side. Vaguely, she registered Elsa lifting her up.

"Did I hurt you?" Elsa stammered.

"N-No! I'm fine," Anna said. She pulled away and steadied herself to prove her point. "See, I'm okay. That was just...intense. Wow."

Anna looked down at herself and admired her new dress, made of ice and given form over her skin, not merely building atop another mundane base. It was beautiful, far more beautiful than even the last dress Elsa had made her, but the beauty lay in that they were making progress. It was tangible proof that Elsa could relearn control, proof that Elsa was more than the weapon she had learned to be.

"I told you there was nothing to be afraid of," Anna said.

For the longest time, Elsa stayed silent with her head bowed, her face shadowed so that Anna could read nothing of her expression. All she felt from the reliquary, even, was simple mute shock that told her little else of what Elsa was feeling, relief or otherwise. Anna wasn't worried. She knew that this time, this time everything would be all right.

Elsa raised her head and smiled.

"Now I know."

* * *

As Elsa grew more and more confident, she began to use her magic in tiny, mundane ways to refine her control. It all culminated over breakfast one day, when Anna took a sip of her water and found it suspiciously warm. She eyed the glass for a while, wondering if she was going crazy. Never mind that warm water tasted a little strange, feeling _anything_ warm in the palace of ice was unusual in itself.

When Anna looked at Elsa, the queen only smiled slyly.

Anna watched, perplexed, as Elsa waved her hand in a half-arc and ice cubes formed in mid-air. When Elsa extended her arm, the cubes slowly levitated across the table and neatly deposited themselves into Anna's drink, making only the tiniest of splashes. Anna stared into her glass for a moment, and then looked up to Elsa. She appeared so enormously proud of herself that Anna burst out laughing.

"Is something wrong?" Elsa asked, smile vanishing as her eyebrows knit together.

"I-It's just…" Anna fought back her giggles, trying desperately to keep a straight face. "That was so corny! Did you set this up to show off?"

"I thought it would be impressive," Elsa admitted, now ducking her head uncomfortably. Anna sprang from her seat, bolted across the distance between them, and leapt into Elsa's lap to give her a tight hug, moving so fast that Elsa's chair slid back from the force of her charge. Elsa let out a tiny _oof_ but held on.

"You are the strangest and the most wonderful person I know," Anna said.

Elsa shifted and looked away. "If you say so."

"Hey, I'm serious. I'm sorry I laughed, I only thought it was cute. Don't be mad?" Anna placed a feather-like kiss over the side of Elsa's jaw, and then another, tracing down to her chin until she felt Elsa smile.

"That won't get you out of everything," Elsa said, folding her arms around Anna and tucking her head snugly beneath her chin. Anna stifled a laugh when Elsa pressed a kiss to her hair.

Anna grinned. "If you say so."

They sat there together for a long time, breakfast forgotten. Anna closed her eyes and breathed in the crisp smell of ice and snow while Elsa brushed through her hair, playing with the platinum strand again. It had been a little disconcerting for Anna at first, to not feel a heartbeat, but once she remembered why she never thought twice about it again. But Elsa herself had always been unwilling to let her come that close. Being together like this was a first.

"Does it bother you at all?" Elsa asked quietly.

"I know you have a heart. It's with me," Anna said. She sat up and looked Elsa in the eyes, leaning forward so her forehead met hers. "I've never minded. No matter what, I'll always love you."

"I…" Elsa swallowed and closed her eyes, clearly struggling with the words. Instead, she kissed Anna softly on the lips. "I feel the same," Elsa said.

"And that's all I need."

Elsa had never directly said she loved her. Anna knew it made Elsa uncomfortable to say those three little words, and she didn't need them. Words were just that, words. Words could be a lie or be taken back or even be forgotten. They had more, much more than that…but Anna wouldn't have even needed the reliquary to know that Elsa loved her. It was in everything she did, the way she looked at her, the way she smiled only for her, the way she held her. That was enough.

"I'm going to try something else," Elsa said. She shifted and moved Anna so she sat properly on the chair, then rose to her feet.

Anna watched as Elsa took a few steps back. Her hands moved in slow revolutions around a growing orb of ice, and then Elsa pulled in both directions. Before Anna's eyes the orb stretched and reformed into a thin column, as malleable as any metal. The invisible hands of a crafter shaped out individual holes along its length, refitted them with keys, and all the while a pencil-thin engraving was carved out into a helix. Even the end was capped with a crown.

"A flute," Anna gasped. She remembered Rafael telling her had Elsa learned to play what amounted to every instrument Anna knew, but it was one thing to hear it and another thing to actually see Elsa _create_ her own flute. The level of craftsmanship was amazing. A flute of ice, each individual key composed of dozens of fractals so they shone like diamonds.

Elsa only smiled, lifted the flute to her lips, and began to play.

It was a quiet, melodious sound. Notes began as hollow, maybe the slightest bit unsettling, even, with a melancholic tinge that was beautiful but haunting. They dragged out more and more before diving into a whirlwind of unison notes of unrelenting tempo, into visceral and gut-wrenching pain, horribly real and raw as though being utterly exposed. Anna listened with bated breath, watched as Elsa closed her eyes and played, until she thought she could bear it no longer.

At last Elsa shifted her fingers over the keys and the melody changed. The tempo slowed again, still mellow, but brighter, hopeful, like the break of dawn. There was a tinge of that same bittersweet sorrow and there always would be, but the soft music was clearer than what it had started out as, elegant and intimate. A comfortable humming, no longer shrill but penetrating all the same. It salved the wounds from before. It was calming.

It reminded Anna of Elsa.

Elsa lowered the flute and opened her eyes. Only when she stepped closer and bent down to her knees to wipe the tears from Anna's face did Anna even realize she had been crying.

"I'm glad I have you," Elsa said. "I was starting to believe that the world had nothing left for me, nothing but darkness, and then I found you. You convinced me there can still be light. Do you…understand?"

_I want to see you every evening and every morning and every night and every day. I want to go where you go and leave with you following, to smile when you laugh, to cry when you suffer, to hear your voice and even your silence. I would spend eternity watching you stumble over your feet and yawn too loudly, eat too quickly, speak too rashly. And I would stare into your eyes as they tell me you would do anything for me, but I don't want you to give up any more for me, only me._

_I love you, Anna._

"Don't cry. It doesn't suit you," Elsa said aloud. "You taught me how to smile again."

"It's because I'm happy," Anna said. "Sometimes we're so happy that even a smile isn't enough, and you just need to cry it out. You've done it too. Remember that?"

"...Yes. Markus taught me how to live, but you've taught me how to be alive." Elsa took Anna's hand in her own. Anna knew Elsa could feel the shared pulse of their hearts beating at the tips of her fingers. "I can't thank you enough. I wish – I wish I could say how I feel out loud. You deserve more than what I can give you through this bond, whatever it is."

"That doesn't matter to me. What would change?" Anna tightened her grip when Elsa began to pull away. "Whatever you think I deserve, I don't want it. I want you."

Suddenly it dawned on Anna why something about this reminded her of the past. Only their positions had been reversed. Elsa had been the one seated on a grand chair, though it was a throne, and Anna had been the one kneeling, but at a distance. Elsa had looked at her, and then she had said…

"There's just one thing..." Anna began, and Elsa widened her eyes before finally giving in to the memory, laughing softly. They both finished the sentence at the same time. "I want her."

Anna burst into laughter, letting herself fall off the chair without a worry because she knew Elsa would catch her. They tumbled to the floor in an undignified sprawl, and this time Elsa laughed louder, freer, joining in just as rambunctiously as Anna. Anna turned her head to the side and saw Elsa with a wide grin on her face, an actual _grin_ and not just a half-smile. Even her eyes were curved into crescents.

"Things _have_ changed quite a bit. In a good way," Elsa added. Anna laughed again and squeezed her hand in reassurance. "Who would have thought?"

"Why did you take me with you in the first place?" Anna asked. It was probably a sensitive question, but she was glad that Elsa didn't pull away. "Seriously, that came out of nowhere."

"It was a whim. I barely thought about it before the words left me," Elsa admitted. With her free hand she swept her hair back, all the while staring up at the tall ceiling. "It was just that…you were the only one who wasn't afraid. There was no judgment, not of my _powers_, anyway, but because of what I had done and I – I was so, so curious." Elsa shook her head. "No, I was _fascinated_. And wary, because you were everything I wasn't and you were so alive while I was…dead, inside. I regretted it as soon as I said it, and later I told your father you could refuse. I was surprised when you agreed."

"Pappa told me that," Anna said.

Elsa shifted so she was looking at her, and Anna cracked a smile when Elsa asked, sounding endearingly confused, "Why did you come, then?"

"Duh, I thought he was lying," Anna snorted. "Either that or you were just messing with us, I had no idea I actually had a choice. So it was all an accident then. A really good accident."

"It was a poor decision on my part," Elsa said.

"Are we going to go through this again? You know that I want to stay with you…"

"I know," Elsa said, smiling, but her smile dropped almost as quickly as it came. She sat up and rubbed at her temple, chronic headache no doubt returning. "But I'm worried it won't be safe for you here."

Anna situated herself behind Elsa and moved her hand away, replacing it with her own hands and feeling Elsa relax under her touch. "You need to stop stressing yourself out so much. You're getting headaches too often, I'm starting to worry."

"A side-effect of creating a reliquary, I believe. I may have perfect recall now, but my thoughts are so tempered by it that they become overwhelming," Elsa said.

"What does _that_ mean?"

"My mind is too focused for me to rest," Elsa explained, and it clicked in Anna's mind that she had been pushing her unwanted memories away and streamlining her thoughts for years and years on end. Small wonder she had headaches. Elsa turned around to face her and said, "Anna, I want to be honest with you. Arendelle is suffering from a shortage."

Anna swallowed, too stunned to notice Elsa lowering her hand and rubbing circles onto her skin. "Is everything going to be all right?"

"They will be. I'm going to Weselton soon," Elsa said.

"Oh. Okay, that sounds…that sounds fine." Anna only realized a split second after what exactly Elsa meant. Weselton wasn't going to just hand over supplies. "Wait, but then…"

"I promise you that I'll keep casualties to a minimum," Elsa said quickly, but at her words, visions of the exact opposite flashed past Anna's eyes. Blood, so much blood, everywhere...

Anna only realized she was staring off into space when Elsa lightly shook her. "S-Sorry, I just–" Anna blinked hard, trying to get rid of the phantom images lying atop her normal vision. "I'm okay."

"…If you're sure," Elsa said. She continued, "I'm more worried about leaving you here alone. But…I could bring you with me."

"No," Anna said. She shook her head when Elsa opened her mouth to argue. "No, I'll stay here. I know you don't really want me to go."

Anna could feel it; Elsa was afraid of letting her see that darker side of her, afraid she would reject her afterwards. Even if Elsa hadn't been aware of the images she at least knew there was no point in lying, because she didn't deny it. And if she were being honest, not even Anna herself was sure she could accept Elsa freely using her powers to kill…but there was another reason she wanted to stay behind.

"But it's dangerous here," Elsa said. "I'll be too far away, I won't be here to protect you from the brothers or even the Sorcerer if he makes a move–"

"And I'll distract you even more if you bring me to a war," Anna said. "You've already been hurt once when I was targeted. If you bring me…" It would be so obvious how easy it was to hurt Elsa through her. Anna wouldn't allow it. "Everything will be fine here. I'll have Alek and Edmund. You can't tell me you don't trust them at least?"

"But still…"

"Just come back quickly," Anna said. When Elsa looked unconvinced, Anna put on a smile. "Come on, I'm sure nothing bad is going to happen, I'll even hold down the fort for you for a little bit. Don't bring anyone else back this time though, I don't need a roommate."

It was a forced joke and she knew it. Elsa said nothing for a long while, until at length, she sighed. "Nothing I say will convince you otherwise?" Anna shook her head silently and Elsa said, "Three days. I'll be back in three days." She rose to her feet.

Anna caught her wrist, and Elsa looked back in confusion. "Trust me, I can handle myself. Don't worry about me and just stay safe."

"You're forgetting who I am. Nothing can hurt me," Elsa said.

"No one is invincible. Not even you," Anna said. "Just remember that I'll be here waiting for you, okay?"

"…I will."

Anna watched as Elsa walked away. The soft folds of her dress shifted into something darker and sharper, plated with armor, the ends flared out starched and rigid. The collar rose into a metal-ice alloy pointed like the end of a blade. The arches of a crown affixed her head.

She was Queen Elsa once more.
