**Chapter 35: Yes, I Want to Build a Snowman**

Anna woke the next morning refreshed, but there was something strange about…

She was in her own room.

She was home.

Flinging off the covers with more energy than she ever possessed in the mornings, she stepped onto the carpeted floor and spun in a circle, gasping as she drank in the familiarity of a home she had left behind. Old trinkets she had picked up in the market were still lying on her desk: an antiquated dual-unicorn knife-rest that used to be a fashion statement for the dinner table, but which Anna used as a good luck charm; a weathered shield decorated by a crest of a red bird; and a badly done painting depicting benevolent trolls under the northern lights, something of an old folk tale in Arendelle.

Anna went into her bathroom to freshen up, keen on seeing her father and embarrassed she had fallen asleep before arriving. Thinking back, Elsa must have carried her here. Anna reddened at the thought of everyone seeing her clinging to Elsa, but it was also warming that Elsa was willing to _let_ them see her carrying someone. She splashed some more water on her face until she calmed down.

When she stepped back into her room, she heard voices outside the door.

"Your Majesty, Princess Anna is still asleep," Gerda said, and Anna squealed at hearing the voice of her old caretaker. "It wouldn't be proper–"

"I appreciate that you have Anna's interests in mind, but your concerns are unnecessary." It had to be Elsa, Anna thought. No one else sounded quite that authoritative. Anna grinned when the door opened, Elsa striding in while Gerda lagged behind looking stricken. "I told you she was awake," Elsa said.

Anna waved. "Morning, Gerda!"

"G-Good morning, Princess Anna." Gerda blinked and turned to Elsa, so surprised she forgot to address her with honorifics. "How did you–?"

"Doesn't really matter," Anna interrupted. She swept Gerda into a hug, grinning when it took no time at all for her to return the embrace. It was like she had never been gone. "It's so great to see you! And _you_ look great, Gerda. Did you change your haircut?"

"Oh, I did!" When Gerda smiled, she did so without reservation. Wide and toothy, her smile was just an expression of happiness and relief. No ulterior motives hidden beneath the surface, no pretense of joy for the sake of pleasing her. "I knew you would notice. Does it make my face look thinner?"

"It does! Do I look any different?" Anna asked.

"Maybe just a little taller?"

"Gerda, I'm eighteen. I don't think I'm growing anymore."

"Nonsense," Gerda said, tutting in disapproval. "People never stop growing! Just that they grow _out_ instead of _up_, so you might need to cut back on the chocolate thing…"

"And whose fault was that?"

"Well, hopefully the weight goes where you want it," Gerda said. Anna furrowed her eyebrows, not understanding, and the maid, practically cackling, motioned with her hands to _above_ her stomach.

"Gerda!" Anna flushed.

Elsa cleared her throat. "I hate to interrupt, but I need to speak to Anna. If you'll excuse us, Gerda?"

Anna held back a laugh when Gerda jumped, apparently having forgotten that Elsa was also in the room. After giving a curtsey, Gerda backed out. From the way she eased the door shut, Anna could tell she was worried. Not for the first time, she wondered how exactly everyone thought she was treated in the Southern Isles. It should have been proof enough that Elsa wasn't the monster they thought she was when she brought Anna back to visit home, even deigning to carry her, but old habits die hard.

Once they were alone Elsa turned to her, lips twitching with repressed laughter. "You two _are_ close. If I hadn't interrupted, we might have been here all day discussing…that."

"Now our relationship is _too_ normal," Anna groaned. "I even get to be embarrassed by family members."

"Normal is good," Elsa said. "After all, my family tried to kill us."

"Morbid. Anyway! Sorry I passed out on you last night, I bet it was so awkward." Anna bit her lip. Hopefully she didn't drool on Elsa. "Were you bored?"

"I found things to hold my interest," Elsa said, eyes growing unfocused for a moment. Anna almost missed it, but she looked troubled. Before she could ask, Elsa added, "Before I forget, we need to talk about what we're going to do about...us."

"Why does that sound so serious?"

Elsa fidgeted and actually shrugged, the awkward motion looking so out of place for her that Anna gaped. It took a good ten seconds for Elsa to blurt out, "I'm not sure what we should tell your father."

"O-Oh. _Oh_." Anna clapped her face in her hands, pushing up her cheeks and groaning. "Oh, this is going to be one awkward conversation. Just let me do the talking."

Somehow, Anna didn't think it would blow over too well that she and Elsa had come back _together_. Forget propriety, Elsa had conquered their kingdom. Anna hadn't thought about it in so long that she almost forgot Arendelle was now a vassal state of the Southern Isles, but she didn't see Pappa being pleased that she was romantically involved with the kingdom's worst enemy. Well, Anna thought, drawing up her courage, she had to try. Maybe she could do something to mend the situation. Maybe she could convince her father that Elsa wasn't who they thought she was.

"I was thinking we should just avoid that conversation altogether," Elsa said. "I don't want to make things difficult for you."

"What?" Anna shook her head. "No, I don't want to hide. It's not fair to you. I mean, I'm not ashamed of being with you and I want Pappa to know–"

"I understand, and I'm grateful. But…" Elsa frowned. "Sometimes hiding your thoughts isn't out of bad intention. It's because you care about someone. Wouldn't you rather spare your father the grief?"

"I'm not sure I agree with that," Anna muttered.

"If it were me, I'd rather not know. I'd rather be kept in the dark, so I could spend more time with you without worry. It would only hurt for longer if you told me sooner."

"Now I really don't agree with that."

"I know," Elsa said. "But I think it's the best thing to do for now. Spend some time with your father without making things difficult because of me. Don't spoil this chance."

Six months had passed. She hadn't seen her Pappa in six months, and now there was this small window of time. If Anna were honest, she _was_ reluctant to bring up a subject potentially damaging to their relationship. In no scenario could she imagine her father being happy about this. She would tell him another time, Anna decided. Next time, or even just a bit later, she would be more prepared to tell Pappa everything. Just not right now. It _was_ for the best. Right?

"It's okay," Elsa murmured.

"…All right, if you think so." Anna hugged Elsa and then pulled away with a grin. "We can go exploring later! We'll just pretend to be civilians. I don't think people will recognize you as long as you're not all Ice Queen. You'll have to wear something normal from my wardrobe."

"If I _have_ to," Elsa said.

Anna laughed. "I'll see you then!"

She kissed Elsa on the cheek and left the room, hurrying to her father's study. Arendelle Castle had a distinctly welcoming air in contrast to the cold, forbidding Southern Isles Castle, brighter, more colorful. Though the leaves were beginning to change color and harkened the arrival of autumn, the sunlight still brought with it the warmth of summer. Anna walked lighter than in the Southern Isles, where the oppressive atmosphere weighed down her every step. Before long, she stood outside her father's door.

Anna raised her hand to knock, but paused an inch away from the door. She took a deep breath, but her heart still pounded so powerfully her head swam. It had been so long. Part of her was scared that maybe either her father or herself had changed too much, that maybe their relationship wouldn't have the same easy understanding as before.

She _knew_ that she was different now. All these years, her father had sheltered her and done everything in his power to preserve her sense of wonder in the world. Agdar had told her once that her compassion and optimism was a rare gift, one that could easily be tarnished. But she knew more than the confines of this castle now. She experienced greed and hate and desperation; Anna had left an innocent and returned having seen much more than her father ever wanted, horrors that taught her the outside world wasn't always perfect and beautiful. Was she still the Anna who believed in having faith?

But did that really even matter?

Her father was still her Pappa.

Anna pushed the door open.

Agdar was seated at his desk, hunched over documents, and Pappa looked older than Anna remembered. Strands of grey hair decorated his temples, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes had deepened. New stress lines had developed where there was once smooth skin. Anna stood there and stared for a moment, hardly daring to believe that her father was really there, watching him work as she often did before.

Try as she might to contain it, a muffled sob escaped her lips. Agdar looked up and froze at the sight of her, blinking hard, until Anna managed a weak smile and he rose from his desk, taking slow, careful steps toward her. Anna closed the rest of the distance and rushed into his arms. Pappa was the same as before, still strong, still steady, not even wavering for an instant.

"Anna," Agdar murmured, kissing the top of her head. "Everything is going to be all right. You're home now. I'm here, Anna. I'm here."

"I missed you," Anna said.

"I missed you too." Agdar took a deep breath. Anna swore she heard him fighting back tears. "I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you had to be our sacrifice. All of this is my fault."

"It wasn't like that. I was happy I could do something for Arendelle," Anna murmured. "And it hasn't been all bad. I'm stronger than you think, Pappa."

"Yes. I know." Agdar pulled away and took a closer look at her, smiling a sad smile. "You look the same, Anna. But I've aged so much."

"Not true. Still looking great, Pappa."

Agdar laughed but nodded anyway. "Tell me how your days have been."

"Not too bad," Anna said. She disregarded the parts about the Sorcerer, which went from _not too bad_ to outright _terrifying_. Like Elsa had said, she would spare her father the pain. "It was rough at first, but once I got used to the place, I adapted pretty well, I think. Met the princes. Mostly jerks, but I actually made friends with some of them. I think you'd like them."

"It seems Elsa is fond of you too," Agdar said.

"Wh-What?" Anna fought back a rush of heat, praying that her face didn't redden.

"She carried you here last night while you were asleep."

Anna breathed a sigh of relief that he hadn't noticed anything…more. But all the same, part of her wished that he _had_ and she could tell him everything. She comforted herself with the thought that not saying something wasn't quite the same as outright lying, but Anna wondered how he would take it when he finally _did_ find out. She had never hidden anything from her father. But Elsa had a point. Pappa wouldn't give them his blessing now. She had to convince him that Elsa was different first.

"I'm glad that you were not mistreated," Agdar continued, eyes becoming unfocused as a dark, haunted look passed over his face. "I had worried that…"

"No, I'm really okay. And I've learned a lot too," Anna insisted. "Especially about Elsa."

Agdar smiled. "Yes, I know. You've done well, Anna. I told you only to take care of yourself, that I didn't expect anything more…but I've never been more proud."

"Umm. Sure?" Anna didn't understand what he meant by that, but she seemed to be getting somewhere. May as well run with it. "So I wanted to tell you about–"

"Everything is under control," Agdar said, clapping Anna's shoulders and looking her in the eye with a heavy stare. "Don't worry, Anna. You've done your part wonderfully. Leave the rest to me."

"No, I meant about Elsa–"

"I know. She trusts you."

Well, that was technically true. Anna held back a frown at the odd look in her father's eye, a sort of tight resolve that was half-steel and half-remorse. She honestly had no idea what was going on anymore. She just assumed her father was still sad about having to give her up. Maybe now wasn't the best time. Yes, Anna decided, she would just try again later.

"All righty." Anna gestured to the door. "I'm going to go meet up with Elsa now, I think she's waiting for me. We'll talk again later, right?"

"We'll have much more time soon."

"I'm not sure how long we're staying," Anna warned. "It might just be a few days."

"Of course," Agdar said, nodding with a business-like air normally reserved for the political scene. "Very soon, then. Remember that there's nothing to be afraid of anymore, Anna. You're home now."

"Yeah." Anna hugged her father one more time. "It's great to be back, Pappa."

"It's great to have you back." Agdar squeezed back before letting go, giving Anna a proud smile. "Now then. It's best that you don't keep Elsa waiting."

Well, Anna thought, Pappa didn't seem to hate the idea of her spending time with Elsa.

It was a start!

* * *

Everyone gave her a wide berth, but Elsa was used to people distancing themselves from her. That treatment here, at least, was justified. She entertained herself watching the staff scurry about while trying to sneak glances at her; Elsa pretended she didn't notice their curiosity about her odd choice of dress. Meant for Arendellian royalty, the teal-and-black dress had belonged to Anna but was shuttered away in the back of her closet. Anna seemed to prefer bright shades of red and blue, but Elsa couldn't imagine herself wearing those.

And there was Anna now, running up with abandon and, strangely, a beaten-up bag on her back. Elsa raised an eyebrow and the princess paused halfway through a hug, arms still raised. She tilted her head toward the maids, Gerda included, spying on them. Anna, seeming to remember that no one was supposed to know about their relationship, swung her arms around like she was only stretching. Elsa almost winced at the banal save, but the maids seemed convinced enough.

"All right!" Anna exclaimed. "Are you ready for a tour of Arendelle?"

"Are you sure this is enough to convince people we're civilians?" Elsa wasn't impressed by the finery of their garb, but it was still far superior to what commoners wore. Anyone halfway observant would notice.

"Nope, but good point! Which is why I brought these," Anna said, swinging the satchel in between them and pulling it open with aplomb. She withdrew two brown cloaks made of coarse fabric and threw one on, then offered the other to Elsa.

Elsa stared at the cloak and wrinkled her nose.

"It works," Anna said.

"…All right, but no one hears about this." Elsa sent a sweeping glare around the hall until the busybodies resumed their work. She pulled the cloak over her head, missing the cool, airy freedom of her ice-dress.

With their disguises perfected, they set out. Anna pointed out the ducklings in the courtyard and played with them for a little while, setting one particularly ugly cretin on Elsa's shoulder. Before she could do anything, it had decided she was a perch and sat down on her head. It refused to let go of her hair for a good three minutes, and any attempts to pry it off led only to loud squawks; Elsa didn't have the heart to blast it away. Eventually the duckling became bored and hopped off, and Elsa dragged Anna away. Anna kept saying she had secretly enjoyed playing with them, and while Elsa continued to deny it…

Maybe it was just a _little_ nice that the things hadn't been smart enough to be afraid of her.

Passing through the gates, they followed the cobblestone road to town. In the Southern Isles, the royal family had kept a respectable distance from the commoners; Arendelle apparently deigned to be in close proximity with them, because the town started almost immediately where the castle ended. Elsa stiffened at the sight of a crowd milling about, instinct warning her of unseen danger lurking in the guise of civilians. It would be easiest thing in the world for assassins to wade through the sea of people…

"Relax," Anna whispered. She took Elsa's hand and guided her around the crowd to stand at the edge of the market, allowing her to observe with a little more breathing space.

Fighting back her anxiety, Elsa took in the sight of the bustling marketplace. So many people so close to her, but none of them seemed to pay her any mind. Perhaps one or two glances at the rare platinum shade of her hair, but their interests moved on within seconds. It was disconcerting to be so casually dismissed. Usually, she was stared at with widened eyes either haunted by fear or clouded by hate. Elsa had to admit that the change was…agreeable.

"See, nothing to worry about. Out here, you're completely ordinary," Anna said. With her lips set in a wonky grin she added, "In the best way."

Elsa smiled. "What do you do out here?"

"Just look at random stuff!" Anna took her hand again and led her towards the bustle. "There is _always_ something new here. Come on!"

It was an eventful few hours.

The Garden Market thronged with people clustered around the stands, and the cause was obvious in the air, the fragrant aroma of strawberries wafting from crate upon crate of the tender red fruit. Elsa overheard the locals saying it was a better season than usual despite the recent drought wreaking havoc on the wheat crop. It was apparently becoming a bit of a fad to serve strawberry.

"Do you like strawberries?" Anna asked.

"Dipped in chocolate," Elsa said, and Anna grinned.

Walking into the Baker's Corner, they found the products of the fad: strawberry pie, strawberry parfait, strawberry funnel cake, all lined up on display in carts. Anna's eyes roved over the treats with such ravenous hunger that Elsa conceded and took one of the funnel cakes before realizing she had nothing to pay with. Anna needed to talk their way out of the mess – infectious cheer so charming that Elsa had the fleeting thought that Anna could be very, very dangerous – and pay the cart owner. It took a while for Elsa to wrap her mind around the fact that _Anna_ possessed more common sense than she did.

The Crafts Bazaar was full of stalls covered by awnings of every color, each space with wares put out on display. Anna ricocheted from one stall to the next, but Elsa took her time studying the merchandise while a plump stall-keeper picked at his nails. She sifted through a cart of trinkets and baubles, running her fingers over wood-carved statuettes and admiring the poems scribed on painted paper lanterns. All made of poorer material than she was used to now, but charming. It was all very foreign to her, but at the same time…not. She had been here before. She hardly remembered those times, but her parents had taken her here when she was young. Strangely enough, the thought didn't sting.

"Something on your mind?" Anna asked, reappearing from behind and nearly making her jump. "Or if you see something you like, remember you have to pay for it–"

"Please don't remind me," Elsa said, growing flustered when the shopkeeper perked up. She took Anna's hand and led them away from his watchful eye.

At another table lay an assortment of weapons. Elsa stiffened at the sight, but she hastily relaxed her muscles when she realized they were only toys, steel replaced by smoothed wood painted grey. Anna snorted but made no mention of it, pulling Elsa over to the table. With a gleeful gleam in her eye, Anna perused the selection.

"Awesome," Anna said, picking up a wooden shield and sword. "Don't I look like a knight?"

"You're holding it wrong," Elsa said. She stepped behind Anna and reached around, adjusting her hand so it fell lower on the sword grip, away from the crossguard. "Relax your index, or you'll be inflexible."

"O-Oh."

"Don't bend your elbows too much or too little," Elsa continued, shifting Anna's arms. "Muscles on the upper arm should be relaxed, but tight on the lower arm."

Anna squeaked.

It took a moment for Elsa to realize she was making Anna flustered. Caught up in the moment and moving on instinct, she didn't notice how closely they were pressed together, or even the way her lips hovered centimeters away from the shell of Anna's ear. Elsa pulled away, clearing her throat.

"Do you want me to show you how to use it properly?" Elsa asked.

"Y-Yeah!" Anna handed the sword over, and Elsa took a moment to adjust to its weight and balance. It had been a long time since she used a sword, but the muscle memory never left. Elsa moved through a simple form, moving the sword up and around, then crouching and stabbing backward. She moved slowly, taking deep, calming breaths to prepare for what came next.

In the next instant, she swept through a chaotic sequence. Her feet never once stopped moving, always pivoting and bringing her to a new spot as her sword slashed at invisible enemies. An unexperienced eye would only see a blur of grey as Elsa switched from standard to reverse grip, transitioning between stances and counters and flowing from offense to defense without pause. It had been _too_ long. She'd forgotten the exhilaration of using a sword. Elsa threw the blade in the air, grabbed the hilt again in a reverse grip, and then stabbed it to the ground to finish the form.

She was greeted by applause.

Elsa had attracted a small crowd, the onlookers standing with awed expressions as they clapped at her performance. The stall-keeper looked pleased at the free advertising, and indeed many children were now asking their parents if they could buy a sword and where they could learn to fight like that. Not wanting to stay in the limelight, Elsa replaced the sword, took Anna's hand, and pushed out of the crowd.

"So that was amazing," Anna breathed. "I almost forgot about those memories of you using a sword."

"I don't use one often now," Elsa said. "I don't ever have to fight so directly."

"Where did you learn all that?"

"It was…" Elsa shrugged. "Gustaf taught me for a while, before I learned about his rebellion. After that, I self-studied."

"…Oh."

By now, they had escaped the throng encircling the toy-weapons store. Before Elsa could say more, they were approached by a little boy carrying a basket. Anna knelt down and smiled at the boy, who held out his basket and asked, "Umm, Miss? Would you like to buy a flower?" Elsa fought back a scoff when Anna squealed and pat him on the head.

"Of course!" Anna rummaged about for some coins, leaving the boy and Elsa to stare at each other. She narrowed her eyes and he ducked his head, blushing so furiously that even the tips of his ears reddened. Elsa frowned and looked away. Anna had to poke the boy once or twice before he looked up.

Taking the money with mumbled thanks, the boy scuffed his shoes on the road. After a moment he nodded to himself, looked towards Elsa again, and blurted, "I think you're really pretty!" Before either of them could react, he dashed away.

Elsa turned to Anna for help, but the redhead had broken down into a fit of laughter. If it were possible, Elsa would have turned red. She pulled Anna aside onto the sidewalk, but she was still in hysterics and, desperate to calm her down, Elsa stuck a hand down the back of her cloak.

"Cold!" Anna pulled free and hopped in place. Ice cubes dropped out of her cloak and she crushed them under her feet, rubbing the small of her back. "God, that was not cool. Or, well, _really_ cool technically–"

"You deserved that," Elsa said.

"It was funny!" Anna said, grinning again. "Come on, you gotta admit that was cute. I bet that kid only walked up because he had a crush on you."

Elsa pursed her lips and said nothing.

"All right, I'm sorry for laughing! Here, I got this for you." Anna held out the flower she bought, and Elsa only then noticed the blue orchid still in her grasp. A beautiful thing, with unveined, unwrinkled periwinkle petals blossoming from a dark stem. Elsa stared at the flower, unblinking, and Anna straightened. "Did I do something–?"

"No. It's beautiful," Elsa said, taking the flower. "It just reminded me of…"

She wanted to say the word home. She was _surprised_ that home was on the tip of her tongue, when that place had never been home at all. But that wasn't true, was it? Elsa remembered the flower garden tended to by her father, remembered the blue orchids grown by her mother. It had been home once. Before the nightmare began, Elsa had loved every moment spent in that household, had _felt_ loved.

"Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't realize…I didn't mean to…" Anna's whisper trailed off, and when she spoke again it was with an edge of surprise. "You miss them."

It wasn't a question, and there was no use denying it when Anna could feel everything she felt, even when Elsa herself didn't recognize what emotion constituted the tightening in her chest, the dryness of her mouth. How strongly must she long for those days that Anna had experienced it too? Was there a way to quantify what she felt, label and categorize, or did she have to suffer the unknown? If that was what it meant to feel, Elsa wondered if being unfeeling was really so bad after all.

"What do you want to…do?" Anna asked.

"I-I don't know," Elsa said, and _that_ was another surprise. She always knew exactly what it was that she was doing. She always stayed in control, because the alternative was to be lost and that was intolerable. Admitting that she didn't know brought a physical pang where her heart had once beaten. "Let's just head back. It's getting late."

"Yeah, that sounds good. Pappa's probably waiting with dinner."

"I'm fine, Anna. Don't worry," Elsa murmured. She took Anna's hand, feeling her squeeze back immediately. "I have you with me."

"You always will," Anna said.

Elsa nodded and led them back to the castle, but her mind never strayed far from the thought of her real home waiting for her to return.

* * *

Though the next few days were just a little awkward, Anna still counted them as a success.

Dinner that first night had been excruciating, having to maintain conversation with a stony-faced Elsa and her obviously uncomfortable Pappa. In a display of admirable coordination, they had nonverbally agreed to sit on opposite ends of the table with Anna in between as a buffer. When Agdar inquired about why Elsa didn't eat anything, the queen only narrowed her eyes and Anna interjected with some excuse about them having had some of the market food.

"Just maybe try a little bit?" Anna asked, shooting Elsa an urgent look and, for good measure, a kick under the table. "Uhh, how about the salad? Healthy."

As directed, Elsa lifted some of the salad to her mouth and, after a short pause in which she eyed both the greens and Agdar as though expecting either one to explode, finally ate. "It's very good," Elsa said.

"That's good to hear," Agdar said, and then the dinner table was once again beset by silence.

It took every ounce of willpower Anna possessed to not hide her face and groan into her hands.

On the upside, the rest of the time was enjoyable.

Anna reserved part of each day to have some private time with her father. During that time they would talk about anything, from mundane subjects like how long the strawberry fad would last, to more serious topics like her experiences in the Southern Isles – Pappa had a rather keen interest in Elsa, and Anna was happy to tell him more. Elsa had taken to scouring the library while she spent time with Agdar, but once she was done, they would either leave to walk around town or stay in and explore the castle.

On the second day, Anna had given Elsa a tour of the castle. Not one of those stuffy formal tours about where the stone was imported from; Anna showed Elsa all the best escape routes for disappearing with stolen chocolate, and introduced her to the myriad of paintings.

"You spent how much time talking to a painting?"

"Don't judge me," Anna grumbled, patting the frame to Joan's painting.

After that they traveled all around, from the ballroom that no one used to the stables that held horses rather than reindeer. Anna acted offended when Elsa was surprised she could ride, but it was mostly an attempt to avoid any questions; Elsa thankfully changed the subject, and Anna was spared from having to admit the number of times she had fallen before managing anything faster than a walk.

Dinner was more comfortable that night. While they never exchanged more than two words while Anna wasn't present, Elsa and Agdar were cordial enough that the atmosphere was never as awkward as the first night. Bouncing back and forth between them had been tiring, but it helped when Anna figured out they had a shared interest in seafaring, so they were _both_ contributing to conversation at the same time.

And then the next day, they went out again.

It was strange to realize she could freely come and go. Pappa used to never let her go out, but now he actually encouraged her to spend more time with Elsa; Anna figured he had the same thought as she once did, that being exposed to more of Arendelle might persuade her to be lenient. Some part of her was cheered by the thought that maybe it meant Pappa could accept Elsa.

Just as Elsa had come to accept Arendelle.

As Anna had promised, there were new sights every day; Arendelle was always bustling with activity, but aside from the usual market wares and performers, the next few days were particularly busy in preparation for an upcoming event. It was on one particular expedition that Anna realized just how much Elsa was enjoying this vacation.

"If we had come a little later, we would've made Yuletide," Anna said, watching as a team of workmen unpacked a crate of reindeer ornaments.

"I'll need to go back to manage the kingdom, but…we could come again in a few months," Elsa said, and Anna swore she heard a hint of excitement in her voice. When she grinned, Elsa looked away.

"It's a promise then! We'll spend Yuletide together, here." Anna could imagine it already, the roads lit up by candles and paper lanterns, festivities at full swing. For now, though, they had fun sharing the rare normalcy.

Time passed.

All was well.

But one thing continued to pull at her mind, and Anna couldn't shove the thought aside because every now and then, when nothing was happening and Elsa thought she wasn't watching, the queen would stare off into nothing. Anna knew what she was thinking about.

Home.

Its pull was so strong and Elsa's suppression so tenacious that Anna could feel the reliquary throb. Every day the pull grew stronger, until the last day before they were set to depart back to the Southern Isles, Elsa was so distracted that Anna knew she had to speak up.

"We can go," Anna said. Elsa looked surprised for a moment, but neither of them needed explanation. Anna laid a hand on her shoulder. "Or if you want to go alone, I can wait for you–"

"No. It's not…I don't want to be alone." Elsa closed her eyes and was silent for a long while, and as much as Anna wanted to know what she was thinking, she stayed quiet too. She probably _could_ feel an impression of Elsa's thoughts, but Elsa had to decide on her own. If Elsa didn't want to face the past, it wasn't Anna's place to force her. At last, Elsa opened her eyes. "Will you stay with me, Anna?"

She didn't need to ask.

"Of course," Anna said. "I'll stay as long as you want me."

* * *

Everything was barren.

It had taken a lot to muster the strength to come here. Elsa had tried to tell herself she would find no answers, no resolution, no great revelation from seeing the place of her death and rebirth. Elsa had died here to give way to the Queen. But for some reason, every time she thought she made up her mind, she would begin to reconsider. Even just telling herself it was to prove her past could not affect her anymore, Elsa knew she _did_ want to return.

And now that she did…

Elsa wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but seeing her old home decrepit was an affront. But, of course, she had wrought all of this damage. She had no one to blame. At her side, Anna muffled a gasp. Where once stood a house was now only a pile of rubble and torn wood planks, splintered a thousand ways, strewn across the ground. Elsa had buried the memories so deep she remembered that day only as a haze of half-forgotten sensations. She remembered the heat of flames upon her hand. She remembered her fear building to a crescendo.

And then…

"I killed them, Anna." Elsa strode closer and knelt amongst the ruins. Maybe it was a memory, but she could smell the copper tang of blood. Either way, it wasn't imagination that made her see stains splattered across the wreckage. "I killed them both."

"You had to. You were protecting yourself," Anna said.

Elsa didn't reply. Some combination of superstition and pragmatism had left this place desecrated. They had lived on the outskirts of the outskirts, the land cheap and the inhabitants sparse. She doubted anyone cared enough to even investigate what happened, and even their far off neighbors would have been unwilling to stay here after the gruesome murder.

"People are so intolerant," Elsa murmured. She thumbed a piece of charred wood. She hadn't realized she released electricity back then.

"Not everyone," Anna said.

"Not everyone," Elsa agreed. "Everyone else thinks my powers are a curse, something to be hidden away, and feared. Except you."

"I didn't mean me," Anna said. She knelt down beside her but Elsa saw out the corner of her eye, her attention remaining fixated on the wreckage. "Out of the whole world, I'm not the only exception."

"Markus," Elsa said, and the answer came as easily as breathing. For most of her life, Markus had been the one constant. Before Anna, she only had him. "I don't know where or who I would be right now if he hadn't found me."

"I-I didn't mean him either."

Elsa turned to see Anna looking down at her hands and wringing them together without explanation. She waited. Eventually Anna raised her head, biting her lip but so certain, so _right_, that Elsa almost feared what she would say next.

"I didn't want to bring this up, but Elsa…Markus was wrong." Anna reached out and took her hand. "All he did was make you into a weapon, and you're so much more than that."

"Markus gave me a purpose," Elsa said.

"No!" Elsa looked down. Anna's grip on her hand had tightened. "What he did was tell you what to do. You're more than that, Elsa. Your purpose is more than, what, being his weapon?"

"It's not like that. Markus taught me how to protect myself," Elsa said. Of course, Anna didn't understand. But that was fine. She would. "Power is the only thing that protects me from the world. It's hateful, Anna. Life itself destroys everything. Power is what I needed. Now I can't be hurt."

"But you're so busy protecting yourself that you've lost everything else important," Anna said. "Don't you get it? Maybe living life will get you hurt, but that's just…part of the whole. You didn't want to get hurt again so you didn't let yourself feel anything, and that's just…not right."

"Why isn't that right?" Elsa asked. She rose and dragged a hand through her hair, turning on her heel so she looked away from the wreckage. What was it about protecting herself that everyone, Anna and the trolls, thought was so wrong? "Markus taught me to forget the pain, and he was right. It hinders me."

"But pain is part of you," Anna said.

"Weakness," Elsa said. She spun back around and could see the child she was, the way she mourned for her happiness, for the past love of her family. She couldn't do anything but build snowmen. She was helpless. "Why does that have to be part of me?"

Anna stood, looking into her eyes the whole time. "There's no _why_ about it. You can't just throw away parts of yourself and think you can keep the rest. You're not happy either when you block everything out. You have to know this, Elsa. Isn't that why you said you want to feel again?"

"Because of you," Elsa said. "I want to be like you. I want to feel like you, I want to love and I want to be happy. I don't want to be…me."

"I'm not perfect," Anna said. She walked toward her, slowly, but Elsa did nothing more than watch her approach. When they were close, Anna reached out and cradled her head. Elsa leaned forward and touched their foreheads together.

"You're perfect to me," Elsa whispered.

Anna smiled. "I'm not. I'm so far from perfect, I have no idea why you'd ever call me that. I'm clumsy, and I don't mean bumping into things, I mean…I try to do the right thing, and most the time, I just make things worse. Like… with you. I don't know how to help you, Elsa. But I'll keep trying. So you have to keep trying. Please don't give up on yourself."

"I can't promise you that, Anna. I can't be her anymore." Elsa looked over Anna's shoulder to her old home, and her lips pulled into a small smile. "I can't be that girl who dreamed of snowmen."

Anna pulled back, grasping her arms and countering her wry smile with a genuine one. "She never left. She's still a part of you, and I'm going to prove it."

"How–?"

"Do you want to build a snowman?"

Elsa stilled. Neither of them had forgotten the disastrous results of her last attempt, but Anna was still smiling, still looking at her with complete and utter confidence. It had been thirteen years since she truly built a snowman. Stumpy and silly, only the unpolished work of the child she had been, but she still remembered how much she valued that snowman. It had been the replacement for love lost from her family. It – _He –_ had been her only companion. Here where they were standing now, the garden of her old home, she had built him.

_Yes, I want to build a snowman._

Slowly, instinctively, Elsa stretched out her hand and willed forth her magic, not the tempest she so often called but the gentler part of herself she had denied for so long. Cold and winter air combined in the center of her palm, compacting into a sphere of snow. She looked across at Anna and the redhead inclined her head in the smallest of nods. Elsa summoned up her courage and launched the ball upward. It wasn't a storm that erupted. Gentle snow drifted down like powder, feather-light against their skin.

Not often did Elsa witness the beauty of her own magic. Awe-inspiring, yes, to summon an avalanche of snow or a cascade of icicles, to split the seas and darken the skies. But there was nothing beautiful that could be found there. Not when the roaring of her fears drowned out the sound of snow song. Not when the haze of her rage beset her vision and masked any elegance to be found in her powers. None of that was magic, just death and destruction; but this – watching the snowflakes fall to earth and settle in a pure plain of white – this was art. Even the destruction of their surroundings didn't detract.

Elsa reached out and caught a snowflake in her palm, feeling it whisper against her skin before the wind carried it away.

Anna smiled. "Let's get started."

While Anna bent down and packed a ball of snow together, Elsa made a careful motion of her hand. She hardly dared to move an inch, and didn't really wave her hand at all, only shifted her fingers. At her feet, the snow drifted up in a lazy spiral and floated back down. Elsa looked toward Anna again, who smiled but said nothing, continuing to smooth down her snowball.

Logically, she knew she should be able to do this. She had regained enough control to manipulate a wave of snow into a board and ride through town, could create her dress of ice without difficulty. But the thought of forming a snowman paralyzed her. It wasn't that stacking three snowballs together was hard. It was the memory of the past that the snowman embodied – of her weakness, of her vulnerability – and she had tried so hard to repress every facet of that memory within herself.

"I'm not sure I can do this," Elsa murmured.

"I know you can," Anna said.

"I don't know how."

"Sure you do, you just don't remember yet." Anna rolled the snowball to her feet, and Elsa watched as it accumulated enough snow to form a sphere large enough for a base. "But we can do this together."

Just as Elsa had reached around Anna to demonstrate swordsmanship, Anna now reached around her waist and placed her hands over hers. Elsa had always found the cold familiar, safe, but never anything… more. Not like Anna's warmth. Sometimes Elsa feared the warmth would burn her, but the gentle glow was every bit as soothing as it was unfamiliar. It used to be like this, Elsa remembered. She had never found her magic to be…cold. Not as she so often did now. It used to leave her warm and satisfied. Anna reminded her of that.

"Together," Elsa said.

Their linked hands glowed blue and, together, they reached out.

_Yes, I want to build a snowman._

Snowflakes swirled all around in a controlled flurry above Anna's snowball. Elsa conducted and sculpted the snow, guided by the warmth of Anna's hand resting on hers, and the light in their hands glowed once in a bright flash before fading away. Before their eyes, the snow began to take a recognizable shape, three spheres, the top elongated into a head. Wood from Elsa's home sheared into twigs and attached to the center sphere, one on either side, and then atop the uppermost in the semblance of hair. Charred coal from lightning-struck remains shaped into buttons and fixed themselves onto the body.

And then the snowman was finished.

For a very long moment, Elsa didn't dare to believe her eyes. Sitting there in front of her was the same diminutive snowman she had built as a little girl. His legs were stumpy and his body too short, all of his imperfections exactly as she remembered, but this was him. Elsa forgot to breathe at the sight. Seeing him again now, still the same when she had changed so much…

"What's his name?" Anna asked, and Elsa finally realized.

She had really done it.

Elsa walked over and knelt down behind her creation, tilting its arms up towards Anna. "Hi, I'm Olaf! And I like warm hugs." Anna let out a loud laugh of delight and rushed over, hugging both the snowman and Elsa, and such of surge of happiness rose arose in her chest that Elsa had to laugh aloud.

"I did it," Elsa whispered. "Thank you, Anna."

Anna grinned. "It was all you."

Elsa was just about to answer when Anna pulled away and rose to her feet, wrapping her cloak closer around herself and rubbing her arms. "Are you all right?" Elsa asked.

"Yeah! Just got cold all of a sudden." Anna breathed into her hands, hopping from one foot to the next. "Weird, I didn't feel cold before."

"We should go back," Elsa said.

"What about Olaf?"

Elsa turned around and smiled at the immobile snowman. "I don't think he'll mind staying here. It'll be warmer at the castle."

"Wouldn't want him to melt," Anna said.

Elsa led Anna back to the castle, leaving Olaf behind them.

Neither of them noticed the color returning in Anna's strand of white hair.
