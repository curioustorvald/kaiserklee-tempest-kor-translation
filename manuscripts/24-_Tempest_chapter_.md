**Chapter 24: The Heartless**

With painstaking effort Saul diverted his attention from the grotesqueness of his surroundings, thankful for the horrid lighting. It was hard to stomach, but at the very least, the murky half-light allowed him some small measure of relief. However, the pungent stench was unavoidable. It was so strong he thought it might permeate his skin and seep into his bones. Maybe it might even pilfer into his soul, if that were still pure.

"You're being too obvious," Saul warned, and the Sorcerer paused in the midst of what he called his _research_ to fix him with a blank stare. "Elsa knows about you. Alek will find you soon. You should never have killed Tobias and practically announced yourself."

The Sorcerer resumed what he was doing, and Saul looked away again when he said, "I have my ways of disappearing. I admit I would have preferred Tobias dead by Elsa's hand, but the difference it makes is little. You underestimate her; Elsa would have figured me out sooner or later."

"One would think that later is better than sooner," Saul said.

"I accomplished what I set out to do. Now I will await Anna here." Without looking away from his work, the Sorcerer tilted his head. "Speaking of being obvious, Reid followed you here."

"What–"

"Dispose of him."

Saul looked to the Sorcerer, unsure of what he had heard. Was he really expected to…?

"Dispose of him, or I will dispose of you both. It's time to prove your worth to me, Saul, beyond your minimal achievements," the Sorcerer said again, sounding unduly amused behind the mask. "Don't be a pawn forever. Think of this as chess, as your queening after crossing the board at last. Just remember a certain creed that I grew up to: Release. Let free. There are no limits."

With that, the Sorcerer vanished. Saul whipped his head around to watch the stairs leading down into the antechamber where he stood, praying. But as if on cue Reid descended the steps, a mixture of fear and disgust on his face, steps slow as if he feared each step might bring greater horrors. Beyond his own shock, Saul felt a smidgen of understanding. Not many lesser people could bear this atrocity.

"What the hell is going on here?" Reid demanded. Whatever indignation he possessed vanished when he looked past Saul to where the Sorcerer had been…working. With a loud cry, Reid flinched backwards and tripped over the stairs, his back slamming into the steps.

"Reid–" Saul moved on reflex to help, but his steps halted and his voice faded when he saw the loathing, the judgment reflected in his brother's eyes. Saul retracted his hand. What did _Reid_ understand? What right did Reid have to pass judgment? After benefiting from him for so long…

With a dry swallow Reid scrambled to his feet, breathing harsh and deep, sweat on his brow despite the cold draft of the room. "I don't know what the hell you're doing here, but this–?"

"Why are you here?" Saul asked.

"I want to know what you're thinking!" Reid yelled, seeming to forget about the sight that scared him so as he stalked forward. "It's like you've gone insane. What is all this? Why did you skip over me and pick Hans as Captain of the Guard? After all this time–"

"I don't owe you an explanation," Saul said. If the buffoon couldn't understand, then that was his own inadequacy.

"So you think you can just toss me aside after coming into power?" Reid sneered and scanned the room, head nodding with fervent disgust. "We'll see what your precious Elsa thinks of this. What do you think she'll do when she finds out? You're done, Saul. Done."

_Kill him._

The Sorcerer's voice passed through his skull and something inside him finally snapped. Saul took a deep breath, but though the next moment felt like an eternity in his mind, in actuality he made his decision in an instant. He had no choice in the matter. It was either kill or be killed. He had to do this to win the game. Reid trusted him, Reid followed him, but Reid _betrayed_ him and Reid was nothing but a liability now so he had to die. When his brother turned his back to leave, Saul felt his body move like he was nothing but a bystander.

Saul felt his blood boil and unnatural strength take hold of his limbs. Without hesitation he threw himself at Reid from behind, shoulder ramming into his back and sending the younger prince sprawling onto the steps of the stairs. Reid turned over but not quickly enough to get to his feet. Saul batted away the weak flails of Reid's arms to clamp a hand down around his neck, his own heart pounding in his throat as he squeezed. It would be over soon. He just had to get this over with…

Except Reid managed to get his leg in between them, and one frantic kick knocked Saul away. Throat freed but gasping for air, Reid only had the energy to lie there.

Saul was furious. Reid just _had_ to resist. He just _had_ to make things hard for both of them.

Unnoticing of the snarl ripping itself from his lips, Saul leapt forward and punched Reid in the face, again and again, ignoring the loud screams and even the pain in his knuckles as the skin tore apart. This time Saul pressed all his weight down to trap his brother's legs, then wrapped both his hands around Reid's throat. Saul's bloodshot eyes bulged in their sockets as he stared down at Reid desperately scrabbling at his hands, then his face, nails leaving tiny scratches on the sides of his jaw. Saul slammed his head down into the corner of the steps and squeezed harder, trying to crush Reid's throat in his hands. Slowly, the resistance weakened. Slowly, slowly, slowly.

Until Reid slackened entirely and Saul finally let go. Reid fell limp, surrounded by a river of blood flowing down the steps from the back of his head.

Saul jerked away and scrambled to his feet, wiping his shaking hands on the white fabric of his jacket and seeing red smear across. Now he realized what he had done. With his own hands, he had just murdered his younger brother. Bile rose to his mouth and he leaned over to vomit, stomach heaving as it contracted, acid burning its way up his esophagus like penance.

"How does it feel?"

Saul looked up to see the Sorcerer reappearing. Of course, he had never left.

"It _is_ a rush to feel another life ending beneath your fingertips. I can't feel very many things, but killing is a constant. It's something that I can control," said the Sorcerer, bending down to examine Reid's body, grasping his chin and carelessly tilting his head this way and that. "I imagine Elsa feels the same way."

"You _made_ me do it," Saul said.

The Sorcerer rose to his feet and extended a hand for Saul. When Saul didn't take it, he slowly closed his hand and chuckled. "If that's what you need to tell yourself. Now then, leave. We should have other visitors soon. I'll take over from here."

Saul did leave, but he left a part of himself there in that cold, dark place stained with blood.

* * *

It was easy taking Weselton.

With the majority of its soldiers locked in their barracks, Weselton was defenseless. Elsa simply strode past the gates and entered the castle unhindered, and she indulged herself by letting her powers free. As the blizzard grew around her like a maelstrom, her senses sharpened and the world filled with sounds and colors missing before. Feeling the full extent of her magic well up inside her in greater and greater torrents of intoxicating power was something she had not felt in months.

She had left the gates little more than rubble torn apart by her storm.

None of her own soldiers had been able to follow her into the castle, repelled by the tempest, but Elsa had no more need of them. There had been a few guards, and these Elsa took care of personally whenever they lacked the sense to flee. She flirted dangerously close to killing them, but she took care to avoid vitals. Either they were struck unconscious by blunt force or pinned to the wall by spikes of ice, but she left them alive.

After that, she walked to the throne room. The rest was simple enough.

From her newly acquired throne, Elsa stared down at the Duke of Weselton. Such a weak man, though he pretended otherwise. Ignorant underneath his petty cunning, spineless behind the delusions of grandeur, but he was still a sight better than the King. Elsa had already thrown him in his own dungeons after he tried to run.

"What I require from Weselton is nothing less than complete fealty. My decisions are not to be disputed, though you will maintain the day to day business of this kingdom. Do you accept my terms?" Elsa asked.

"O-Of course, Your Majesty. Weselton welcomes your rule," said the Duke.

"Our business here is concluded. From now on, you will be Regent," Elsa said.

"Is there anything you require, Your Majesty?"

There was. Elsa rose from her seat and said, "Lead me to the highest point of the castle."

If the Duke found her demand odd, he didn't look it. Instead, he personally showed Elsa to the towers and led her up to the balcony before retreating, giving one last platitude that Elsa waved off without verbal response. Once he was gone, Elsa looked over the edge. From here, she could look out and see the infinitesimally small city sprawled out far, far below, the lives of its denizens tiny, tiny things.

Elsa closed her eyes.

She could feel the Mirror. Shards of it glowed like tiny stars among the mundane human life down below, calling to her with spikes of magic so similar to her own, yearning to be complete once again.

Elsa raised her hands to the sky and let her power surge, building and building towards its apex. Though her eyes were closed she could hear the storm rolling in with loud claps of thunder, could envision the dark clouds obscuring the sun, could feel the feather-like touch of falling snow on her skin. A thin ring of frost circled between her hands, swirling about slowly and then spinning faster and faster, releasing a shrill hum as it expanded and solidified. As her power built, electricity came to life and flickered in white and blue currents around the magnetic ice.

_Come_, Elsa commanded silently.

Shards flew through the air and affixed themselves to the ice, attracted by their likeness, coming from every direction and in every size. None were larger than an inch and some were little more than splinters, but they pieced themselves together as puzzle pieces would join together, spinning this way and that to accommodate. It took only minutes for the whole process to be over, but maintaining her call took every last bit of concentration Elsa possessed. With each shard, the mounting pressure from the unbridled power of the Mirror grew larger, until it felt like trying to contain an ocean.

Until the last piece came, and with it, relief.

Finally, Elsa allowed her power to dissipate and lowered the completed piece of the Mirror. Letting it hover in the air, she inspected it. Jagged around the edges, but it was to be expected. However, the rest of it was perfectly flawless. The pieces had reattached without the slightest mark, leaving nothing to suggest it had ever been shattered. For all that their power seemed to resonate, Elsa knew herself different from the Mirror. Every time she found another piece, the same comparison would race through her mind. The Mirror could be put back together. She was forever unwhole.

And who could she blame but herself? It might have been easy to place judgment on her parents, and maybe part of her did, but in the end she had stained her hands with their blood and she could not find it in herself to think ill of them. Not truly. At times like these, when it became harder to avoid thinking of them, she would remember not the hateful monsters they became but the loving parents they had been. They had treasured her. And then…they had not. Elsa never knew why. Was it really just because of her powers? Was it so hard to accept that their daughter was more than ordinary?

She just wanted to know why.

Elsa reached out to take the Mirror. The moment she touched it–

_"Elsa! Wh-What have you…? Oh, Elsa."_

She knew that voice. It was Elmira. It was her mother.

Elsa blinked, but the world was strange. In place of what should have been vibrant hues were oddly muted colors, every shade appearing weak and washed-out. The world appeared dull, indistinct, as though she were looking through a foggy window. Light filtered through only in the weakest of rays. Elsa could barely make out silhouettes of two taller figures crouched around a third smaller one.

"_It'll be all right, Elsa. You can learn to control it, I'm sure."_

That was Vagn, her father, her _birth father_ and certainly not Markus. Control…her powers? Surely he meant to repress them. Vagn had never cared for control. Vagn had wanted her powers to disappear, had wanted her curse to never show itself again, and if that meant his daughter needed to never show herself again, he was content to lock her away. There had never been talk of learning _control_.

_"We'll be here for you, Elsa. We'll always be here."_

…What?

Before Elsa could even begin to think about the surreality of it all, she was dragged away from the vision or hallucination or whatever that episode might be. Vision returned with dizzying clarity and she was back in Weselton, staring down at the Mirror shard in her hand. It was glowing. Before her eyes the light dimmed, but she had seen it glow. Had the Mirror shown her that? But why had it stopped–

Elsa clutched at her chest, struck by breathless fear.

Darkness. Something was happening. Was Anna in danger? Elsa tried to reach through their link, but it was frustratingly closed to her as it always was. Only Anna could draw on the reliquary. Not even Elsa could discern what her own heart told, cut off from emotion for so many years it left her unable to feel. She mourned the loss before, but now she loathed it. If only she could see as Anna did, she might be able to tell if she were safe. Right now, she had no way of knowing.

Elsa abandoned all thought of the strange vision for now. Nothing was more important than Anna.

_Wait for me._

* * *

Finally, they were here. In moments, they would see the Sorcerer.

Down the long flight of stairs was a simple steel door, and past the door was a hallway stretching on past the eye could see, hidden by darkness. Underground, the heavy air felt as though it could crush bones. Concrete grey walls were illuminated by candles set into the walls, their flickering lights little comfort against the darkness. Quiet pattering reverberated through the long corridor as fetid water collected in puddles along the gritty floor. Worse, the entire place reeked of an awful stench, a mixture of disinfectant and rotting flesh.

"Who was that we heard?" Hans asked.

"Just watch our rear," Alek said, drawing his sword and making a motion for Hans to do the same. "I'll take the front, and Anna between us."

"Why did you bring Anna?" Hans gazed around, jaw clenching as he took in the decrepit surroundings. "I don't know what this is about, but Anna shouldn't be here–"

"Well, I _am_ here, so please don't talk about me like I'm not," Anna interrupted.

"Anna would follow us anyway. At least now we know where she is," Alek said. "And I'm not telling you anything more. I barely trust you enough to have you walk behind me, but I'm out of options."

With that, they set off down the corridor. Alek walked slowly with sword outstretched, and Anna tried her best to control her breathing. Part of it was fear and anticipation, but the other half was simple desperation to avoid the sickly smell. She kept her eyes wide open, but with how dark it was she could barely see anything past Alek. As they walked, the smell only became worse and worse.

They continued edging through that seemingly endless corridor. All that broke the oppressive silence was the sound of their footsteps echoing on the stone, and meanwhile Anna never stopped thinking about all those people the Sorcerer had kidnapped. Never mind why the Sorcerer had taken them. How long had they been down here in the dark and the cold? How many of them were even still alive?

"Anna, close your eyes," Alek said suddenly.

"What? Why–?"

"Just do it. Take my hand, close your eyes, and keep walking forward." Alek reached back with his free hand, and tentatively Anna took it and followed his instruction. "Don't open your eyes until I tell you to."

Part of Anna wanted to just do as Alek said and avoid whatever gruesome sight must have been in front of her. The other part told her that cowardice was pointless when she was already here. Before she could make a conscious decision, instinct made it for her. When Anna first felt the squelch under her boots, her eyes opened on reflex.

There were bodies strung up around them.

Anna jerked back, hand slipping away from Alek and her entire body crashing backwards into Hans, but the motion only made a splash and she looked down, down where she could see she had been stepping in _blood_ all along. She looked back up. It was a mistake. She wished she could look away but she was transfixed by fascinated horror, the sheer brutality of it mind-boggling. All around her was torn skin and snapped bones and mangled flesh, chests flayed open and ribs jutting out, organs exposed to air. It was a miracle that she managed not to throw up.

"Just close your eyes again," Alek said. "I'll lead you out, Hans was right, I was stupid to bring you in the first place–"

"No!" Anna said, steadying herself, _by_ herself, pulling away from Alek as her crutch. She couldn't be a liability forever. She fought past the urge to close her eyes and stared straight at Alek. "It's too late to head back. We need to keep going."

"…Fine," Alek said. "You and Hans go on. I-I'll catch up in a minute–"

"Alek," Hans muttered. "None of them are alive. No need to put anyone out of their misery."

Anna would have whirled around to confront Hans for what he said, but the tremor in his voice told her he was just as shaken as she was. Maybe it was for the best that he could keep a calm mind. It was true, anyway. Some of these bodies were so mutilated they were barely recognizable as human, and Anna couldn't imagine how much worse it would be if they were alive. And even if they found any survivors, how many of them still _wanted_ to be alive?

She had thought they would rescue people, not – not – put them out of their misery.

Anna kept her eyes open as they traversed the rest of the corridor, but after navigating their way through that brutal scene, they encountered nothing else of note. At last, they came to an entryway with yet another flight of stairs down, but somehow they all knew this was it. Whoever was waiting for them would be down below. They stood just outside the arch in silence, no one moving an inch.

Maybe it was nervous energy. Anna just couldn't bear standing still for another second, stuck there in the horrible place, and she took the first step through the arch.

Shadows instantly burst up to block the entryway. She spun around, but Alek and Hans were trapped outside…or she was trapped in. Anna didn't dare touch the shadows, but she could look past the translucent barrier to see the princes standing on the other side with identical horrified expressions.

"Anna!" Alek yelled. "Don't move. I'll come through and get you."

"I-It's okay," Anna said.

It was okay. It was okay. It was okay as long as she kept moving.

Keep. Moving.

Move.

Go.

"Are you insane?" Hans demanded, but from the other side his words sounded muffled and muted, like they had passed through water. "None of this is okay. One of us will get you out–"

"No! You're just going to hurt yourself," Anna said, picking up a stray stone off the ground and throwing it into the shadows. It touched the dark substance and burned away without a trace, not even leaving ashes behind. "See? There might be another way around. J-Just…I'll keep going."

And that was it.

She kept going.

* * *

Already, ten minutes had passed.

Whatever was happening with Anna, neither Hans nor Alek could see. For all they knew…

"We need to find a way through," Alek said, crouched to better examine the barrier.

"Then maybe you should tell me what the hell is happening here," Hans snarled. It was unlike him to sound so agitated, but it was impossible to keep his rage from spilling over into his voice.

Whatever he had bargained for, this was not it. It was partially curiosity about what exactly was so suspicious about Alvard's death, because he knew they weren't investigating his own role in inciting Alvard. Never mind that even if it could be traced back to him, it was no fault of his that a few choice words had led to Alvard's insurrection. More importantly, was there something he didn't know about? But then, when he learned about the disappearances…Hans had joined this little expedition for Anna's sake. Whether it was a whim or something more, Hans didn't know.

Only, for whatever reason, the thought of Anna being hurt was unacceptable.

"Try keeping your mouth shut and being useful instead," Alek replied.

"How do you expect me to do anything when you tell me nothing?" Hans asked, balling his hand into a fist when Alek continued to ignore him. "What the hell is your problem?"

Before Hans could react, Alek sprang to his feet and grabbed him by the collar. His older brother stood a good four inches taller; Hans thought he might be lifted off his feet any moment, but Alek only growled, "You want to know why I don't tell you anything? Alvard! What the _hell_ did you do to him?"

"Nothing," Hans said. "Goddamnit, Alek! Is now the time for this? Anna is trapped in there–"

"Why do you care? What do you even want from her?"

"_Nothing_," Hans said, immediately and without thought, the answer leaving him before he could even think twice. And he meant it. When he realized it, that he really wanted nothing from Anna, that he had no ulterior motives, it scared him more than anything.

Alek dragged Hans closer, and even with the bad lighting Hans could see his reddening face, his pupils dilating. Something was wrong with Alek. For all his rashness, he would know better than this–

"Go to hell. Maybe you'll see your whore mother," Alek spat.

_Kill him._

Hans didn't need a foreign voice in his head to tell him what to do. With a guttural roar he shoved Alek away, pounding blood roaring in his ears and red cloying his vision. With all of this forced camaraderie, he had almost forgotten…but without Anna here between them, now he remembered how his _brothers_ had pushed his mother to suicide, how Alek was just as guilty as the rest. Through the haze of his rage Hans couldn't see the horror on Alek's face, the sudden contraction of his pupils back to normal.

"Hans, wait, that wasn't me–"

Hans drew his sword and attacked.

* * *

Anna wondered why she needed so badly to do this. She couldn't have _not_ walked down those steps. Her pace never slowed from its steady rhythm, though her heart beat wildly and her breathing hitched irregularly. She felt herself move like her body didn't belong to her anymore, like she was only looking in from the outside. It wasn't a very long walk, only seconds before she reached the end. With one last click of her boots tapping against stone, the stairs leveled off into a spacious chamber.

And she saw Reid, standing there as nonchalantly as though they were at a banquet and not in a torture chamber, not surrounded by blood and death.

"You're finally here," Reid said. Anna stayed silent and scanned his face carefully. Reid's lips were stretched into a wild grin from ear to ear and his eyes were lit up with feverish energy, but…

"What happened to you?" Anna whispered.

"You noticed," Reid said, fingers rubbing at the half-dried blood caked on his face and then the horrible gash on the back of his head. "Reid was dead long before you arrived. I'm only borrowing this body for the meantime. It's convenient. Is there anything you want to say to me now that you're here, Anna?"

Small wonder his voice was layered. It was the Sorcerer's own voice on top of Reid's shriller one when he spoke, but when he called her name, Anna was forcibly reminded of her previous hypnosis. She bowed her head, and that was when she saw it. Laying there on a table was another body. Its skin was sliced apart and held back with pins, the thin membrane spread to showcase dark red tissues. Blood poured freely onto the table and stained the gloves Reid wore, and only now did she notice the scalpel in his hands.

"Muscles. If you cut in the direction of the lines, they won't sever," Reid said, pointing out the tissues and cutting as he spoke, as though _teaching_ Anna. "And then continue with the layers…" A second layer was peeled back, and then a third, until the still-pulsing organs became visible within an exposed cavity.

Anna clenched her fists. "Why are you doing this?"

"…Fascinating thing, the human heart," Reid said. Far from the mania of before, his voice was soft now, wistful. Taking off his gloves, Reid reached into the chest of his captive and, to Anna's horror, withdrew the heart with his bare hands. Holding it up to the light as he spoke, he examined it like something precious. "There's this mundane organ that pumps blood throughout the body, and then there's the _heart_ that lets us feel…and not just live, but be alive. That's what the reliquary sacrifices most of all."

"H-How do you know about–?"

"Elsa is not the only one." Reid set the heart back into its place and pointed to his own chest, wry grin on his face. "We are both heartless. But I…I was the first."

"Who are you?" Anna asked.

Slowly, Reid's smile faded. "Just a dying man. You asked me why I'm doing this, and my answer is this: I want to live, Anna." Reid whirled around, spread his arms wide, and exclaimed, "I want to live! Because I want to experience the world, I want to feel, I want to be someone again–" then he spun back around, and this time he was wearing a mask over his face, "–because I want to be more than this hideous thing."

His mask dissipated into shadows and diffused into the air. Anna was horrified that part of her thought she might understand how the Sorcerer felt. But how could she not? Elsa was the same way. But…Elsa hadn't chosen to kidnap and murder. Anna took a step back, unable to stop from biting her lip. "It's not an excuse. Look at Elsa–"

"Elsa lives because of me," Reid snarled. Except it wasn't really Reid. It was Reid's face, but whoever the Sorcerer was, whichever face he bore and whichever shell he hid behind didn't matter. Right now, this was the nameless Sorcerer who spoke. "I was the first; I was the _prototype_ to make sure the reliquary process was safe for Elsa. I was nothing but her guinea pig.

"Oh, I fed Tobias some drivel that the reliquary was _old magic_, but…Markus was its originator. It was _my own father_," spat the Sorcerer, "Markus who ruined me. I was only a child when I sacrificed my heart, but not even the malleability of a child could withstand the loss. Markus learned from my example, Elsa managed to survive it, but what about me? My heart is lost. My heart crumbles away as we speak. I am _dying_, Anna. I am dying so that Elsa might live. Is it fair that – I – should – die – in – her – place!"

With each word, Reid released a blast of magic. Anna crouched and covered her head out of instinct, but the wild shots all missed her even as the chamber shook from their impact. Shadows struck the walls, bubbling and hissing before dying away, having eaten away portions of the stone. With a heavy swallow, the Sorcerer subsided.

"But I don't resent Elsa. It may be that I was imperfect and she was better. It might have even been chance, but she is better than me. And I envy you," Reid said, and Anna looked up to see him calm once again, perhaps even more composed than he ever was. First mania and then fury, and now complete calm. Unpredictable. Unstable. "Someone pure like you is rare. Which is why I wanted to meet you. Can you understand me, Anna, as you understand Elsa?"

It was silent for an eternity.

"Regardless, I enjoyed our conversation. I hope you'll forgive me that I excluded Alek and Hans; I thought it a private matter, to discuss the reliquary. Elsa would not have approved," Reid said, curling his hand into a claw and dragging it down through the air. A deep rumble sounded from behind them. "But now that we're past sensitive topics, I will let them join us. Shall we wait and see?"

"See what?" Anna asked.

"If they manage to make it," Reid said. "Let me prove to you that humans are base, disgusting creatures."

Anna spun around to watch the entrance. Of course, the Sorcerer had done something to them. She waited with bated breath, remembering that it had taken her less than a minute to arrive here. Several passed with no sign of either of the brothers. If they were able to come, they should have been here by now. Anna bowed her head while Reid chuckled behind her, the haunting sound all she could hear.

But just as Anna began to lose hope, there were hurried footsteps.

Anna looked up to see Alek and Hans burst into the room with swords drawn, both looking beaten and battered, Alek bleeding from a long gash on his cheek and Hans bearing a bruise around his neck, but they were _alive_. Anna dashed to their side, unable to stop from hugging them both.

"Is that Reid?" Alek asked, looking over to where the Sorcerer stood with his head tilted to the side.

"It's not really him," Anna said. "The Sorcerer is just…possessing his body. Reid is dead."

"Let the others go," Alek demanded, raising his sword so that it pointed to Reid's neck. "Those people you took. Where are they?"

The Sorcerer only laughed and shook his head. "I have no one to return to you. All of them are here," Reid said, and he pointed at his chest. "All of them are part of me."

Hans narrowed his eyes. "What does that mean?"

But Anna had an inkling of what the Sorcerer was talking about. All this time, he had spoken of staying alive, of fixing himself, and his fascination with the heart, all the experiments he had carried out…

"I did them a favor," Reid said. "They were the wretches and scum of the earth, destined for nothing, caught in the horror of the tantalizing lie called life. I freed them from misery. I gave them purpose."

"You're insane," Anna murmured. She had almost fallen for his appeal to her empathy, almost allowed herself to relate him to Elsa. But the Sorcerer was different. No matter how similar they might be he would never be Elsa, and allowing herself to sympathize was the stupidest thing she could have done.

"Never mind that," Reid said, staring first at Alek and then at Hans. "I admit, I'm not often surprised anymore but you two…I didn't know you had it in you. I'm impressed. Especially by you, Hans. You've been on my strings for so long, I wondered if you would ever break free."

"What does that mean, on your strings?" Hans asked. "I've never even met you–"

"You really thought you were such a master manipulator?" Reid chuckled. "No, Hans. All this time, you were only my proxy. When you spoke to Alvard, I implanted the order in his mind to kill Elsa. When you conspired with Tobias, I gave him the idea to infiltrate the tower. When you talked with Saul, I drove him to jealous rage. Everything you thought you did, Hans, I did for you. It was always me."

Anna looked at Hans, surprised to find she _wasn't_ surprised by all that Hans had done. But when she looked at him now, Hans barely looked like himself. All of his confidence had shattered – eyes wide and hands shaking – leaving him drained as any of the corpses the Sorcerer left behind.

"Pull yourself together," Alek said, and then he turned back to Reid and added, "You can stop with the mind games. You're not going anywhere."

"What exactly are you going to do to a dead body?" Reid chuckled. "You all aren't as fortunate as me, encased by this husk of flesh and blood. I wish you luck in escaping."

With that cryptic message, Reid's body crumpled to the floor.

A loud rumble.

A dull tremor.

A heavy groan.

A series of explosions rocked the entire warehouse, tremors powerful enough to send Anna to her knees. Dust and gravel fell from the ceiling, only a little at first, but then followed by larger and larger chunks of stone that quickly grew to become the size of her fist. Soon, the entire place would collapse.

"Gunpowder," Alek said, sheathing his sword. "We need to get out of here. Now!"

Alek pulled Anna to her feet and ran, but when she looked back she noticed Hans still standing there in a stupor. She called out his name, but he didn't respond. She called his name again to the same result. Alek tore away and grabbed Hans by the shoulder, shaking him and screaming, "Now is not the time! Remember what you told me? We have to go!"

Just like that, Hans snapped out of it. Together the three of them raced up the stairs and back down the corridor they had taken here. Suddenly, it seemed to stretch on forever. Anna dodged the falling debris as best she could, but the rocks had grown larger to nearly the size of her head and the ground shook so badly she could barely keep her balance. Then, just behind them, the ground beneath their feet split with a sharp crack. Anna ran harder, not daring to look either up or down, only straight ahead.

They burst through the door and they were back in the warehouse, but they weren't safe yet. Whatever structural support the warehouse had wouldn't last long, and they were so deep inside that they still had to sprint the last part out. But they would make it in time. They _had_ to.

Except Anna was unused to such rough terrain, such desperate conditions, and even if she had been able to keep up with Alek or Hans, she wouldn't be able to avoid the metal and wood falling like shrapnel. A meter away from the exit, Anna was struck by the edge of a wooden plank and tripped, her ankle twisting under her. Alek shouldered past the door. Hans looked back and saw her trapped. Their eyes met, and suddenly with a sinking feeling in her stomach, Anna knew.

Hans leaned down, took Anna in his arms, and before Anna could open her mouth to protest, to scream, she was tossed out to safety. She crashed into Alek and rolled outside in a heap, and all they could do was watch the inevitable.

With Hans still inside, the warehouse collapsed, burying him under a metric ton of iron.
