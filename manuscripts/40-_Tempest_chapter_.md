**Chapter 40: There Are No Limits**

_Release, let free._

_There are no limits._

Elsa clenched her teeth, hands curling into claws as she dragged them up, and two walls of ice rose in unison. Each one loomed over five meters high, covered with irregular spikes that jutted out without pattern. In between them stood Markus, eyes narrowed as the barbed walls blocked off his escape. Elsa threw out her right hand and the snow at her feet rippled forward, collecting and building into an avalanche by the time it reached the king. She could see nothing of him beyond the great flood of white.

And that was when an opaque grey wall materialized, simply appearing, fully formed, where there had been nothing before. Its surface erupted into black flames just as the avalanche reached. Snow struck the wall with a thunderous crash, and for a moment there seemed to be a stalemate, the snow surging forward, the flames stubbornly spreading. Until, finally, the flames spread onto the snow and the avalanche folded. It was consumed, only feeding harmlessly into the hissing flames, and reduced, bit by bit, until nothing remained. Markus stood unharmed. Elsa drew her hand back, bowing her head.

"Again!" Markus barked, and Elsa corrected her stance. "You are not trying hard enough. I expect more than this halfhearted effort!"

Ice always came from the inside, from her heart and soul, and Elsa only conducted the cold magic outwards. It was free-flowing, like a river of energy coursing through her body. Not like lightning. Lightning originated from the outside, and it backlashed, so that she felt the jolts up her arm, and the numbing recoil, and the horrible pain just as someone would when struck.

It helped fuel the necessary rage.

Elsa drew on her frustration from the realization that she had actually regressed, that she had managed to become _weaker_ over the years, that she had still made no progress towards the Mirror, toward anything. Pain bled up her arm and to her chest, like a suffocating pressure crushing down on her person, but the magic built as she knew it would. Blue-white electricity formed at her fingertips.

She launched it forward, eyes tracking the trajectory, calculating the angles and taking in details no one else could have followed. Lightning struck the wall and the flames parted, revealing the vulnerable inner layer of crystal shadow that shattered upon impact. Markus leapt out of the way, tumbling into the snow, but avoided the bolt of lightning as it passed over his head.

No time to celebrate her small victory; Markus was back on his feet within a second, launching small blasts of shadow from both hands. It was exactly the same as the Sorcerer's magic, and the sight of the purple miasma shared between father and son unnerved her enough that she reacted a half-second slower than she ought. One clipped her side before she could dodge, scalding her skin like burning oil. Whenever she used lightning, her automatic defense was down.

"Concentrate!"

Elsa bit past the pain and rocketed away from the barrage, propelled by bursts of cold air from the base of her feet. She whipped the lightning at Markus, forcing the king to halt his attack. Where the line of lightning struck the ground, all the snow cleared, revealing a deep gouge of blackened earth. Elsa flew around the field, throwing bursts of electricity, but Markus was too nimble. It was the same half-shadow form the Sorcerer had taken, so that he slithered with an oscillating tail of darkness, moving much too fast for her to pin down with linear attacks.

She had been fooled, once.

Elsa summoned walls of ice all around, though Markus paid it no heed. She didn't expect him to. Markus crushed the hastily made blocks in his path, but she continued to summon them, faster than he could break them down. Maybe he realized her plan; Markus soon turned and headed straight for her, but Elsa shoved him back with a gust of air, forcing him closer to the walls. Feeling a surge of satisfaction, Elsa directed her lightning onto the ice. It rebounded off a wall, shattering it with an earsplitting explosion. Though Markus avoided that one, the dodge brought him close to another wall and the lightning ricocheted there next, and then the next wall, and the next. Wherever he went, the lightning followed, tracking his movements so quickly it appeared all the ice exploded simultaneously.

When the smoke cleared, Markus lay on his back.

"I yield," Markus said, and only then did Elsa let her lightning dissipate.

At the sidelines of the courtyard where they trained, Edmund jumped to his feet and clapped. Not many others had the courage to be anywhere close during these matches. It had always been something of a ritual that she and Markus train together, though obviously the practice had been suspended. Now that Markus was back, their training resumed. Markus had not been pleased that she let her skills atrophy.

"Do not allow yourself to fall behind in your training again," Markus chided.

"Of course."

"But Father, Elsa won," Edmund said, grinning wildly. While Markus glowered, Edmund sent Elsa a thumbs-up. "Good show on both sides, but I gotta hand this one to Sis."

"Markus trained me well," Elsa said.

"You, Edmund, would do well to learn humility from Elsa," Markus said, shaking his head, but then his gaze sharpened and he turned away from both of them. It almost seemed, Elsa thought, like he didn't want Edmund to see his expression. "Although…perhaps your opinion of the match may be of worth."

"Oh, I was just kidding around. I don't know a thing about magic, but hey, looks cool." Edmund shrugged, and Markus, strangely, seemed satisfied enough by the lackadaisical answer. Without so much as a farewell, he headed inside, leaving Elsa to continue training on her own.

"You're staying?" Elsa asked, noticing that Edmund made no move to follow.

"Not like I have anything else to do. Maybe I'll learn something." Edmund smiled, making wild motions with his hands. "So, Sis, I could probably hel–!"

And then Edmund abruptly fell silent, entire body stilling.

"Is something wrong…?"

Elsa never finished her question. Releasing a choked gasp, Edmund fell to his knees, clawing at his shirt, clutching his chest with curled hands like he could claw his way through to his heart. Elsa immediately knelt next to him, but she had no idea what could have caused this – Edmund's face screwed up in a grimace of pain, eyes widening so much that every vein was visible. Before long, he fell over completely on all fours, doubled over, uttering guttural moans.

"Edmund!" Elsa exclaimed, but the boy was long past answering. Both his hands were gripping his head now, knuckles white with the force of his grip. His screams were terrible things. Elsa had heard many screams before – of pain, of terror, of anger, of all those base, human emotions – but never this animalistic howl. Every primal shriek ended in a high-pitched whine, as though Edmund were being unmade and his humanity was slipping away.

With great force of will, Edmund forced his head up an inch, just enough to look into her eyes, and Elsa thought she saw a kindred spirit. Elsa braced him as best she could, and just barely caught his whisper, spoken with a voice so desperate that she could tell every _second_ was precious to him.

"_Help me_–_!_"

And then the desperate plea died, replaced by the groans once more. She could do nothing for him. She yelled for help, unsure whether or not to even _try_ to move Edmund, but none came. She only watched helplessly until he fell silent. Edmund had blacked out.

And he was not breathing.

* * *

It was impossible to get into the Southern Isles.

Anna remembered her arrival, and how heavy icebreakers had been needed to get anywhere near the frozen docks. Arendelle possessed those types of ships too, but the majority had been damaged during Elsa's invasion, and afterward, their resources had been funneled away. But even if the icebreakers were functional, their effectiveness was doubtful. They did little during the invasion, and there was no reason to believe they would be any more helpful in cracking the ice around the Southern Isles.

But that was fine, because Anna didn't intend to go back.

Not yet, anyway.

She wanted to, more than anything, but nothing had changed. Elsa had forced her away. It was never a choice Anna had been given. Elsa had wanted Anna to stay, but she still forced her away, and Anna trusted Elsa enough to know there _had_ to be a good reason. She didn't know why, but maybe even Elsa didn't know why. It just had to be that way, maybe. Anna had faith.

But going back now, eventually this would all repeat itself. Everything that went wrong and everything that _was_ wrong between them still existed. Not just what happened with the assassination. It wasn't the root of the problem. Anna couldn't put words to her feeling, but they had both always realized, deep down, that something was wrong, that something between them had always been…unbalanced.

It was the feeling she had, once, right before they came to Arendelle.

It was the feeling when Elsa thought she was losing herself and would have accepted any tether to reality, and Anna told her, "I won't let that happen." It was the feeling when Elsa broke down in tears, and Anna saw every bit of vulnerability, every hint of potential, and then told her, "I can be your heart." Anna had said those things and felt disturbed rather than relieved. She felt guilty. Because when Elsa looked at her with that reverent gaze, like an apostle witnessing deliverance…

It was so very _wrong_, somehow.

Anna sighed.

"It just _has_ to be complicated…"

She wasn't complaining. Nothing worth it was ever simple.

Anna put the thought away to focus on the road. Winter was coming, bringing with it the familiar smell of wood smoke, and cold, dry air that stung in her lungs. During the early mornings, the cobblestone paths were slick with frost remaining from the nightly chill. Knowing her, she would acquire a new set of bruises by the end of the day.

It was worth it, though, to see the lights.

She stood in the marketplace, gazing up at the long strings of lanterns decorating every vendor and stall. Almost all the Yuletide decorations were up by now, and wee-hour workers were quietly putting on the finishing touches to the ensemble as she walked by. In the dim hours of dawn, the lanterns glowed almost as brightly as they would during the night, flickering orange and yellow opposite of the borealis in the sky. Elsa had promised to see them with her, but there she was, alone.

Elsa would have liked seeing the lights, Anna decided.

She moved on from the marketplace, which had never been her destination.

It had been an impulsive decision born from an even more abrupt thought. Once it took hold, Anna couldn't ignore the idea. Maybe it wouldn't help anything, and maybe it was just because she was still clinging to what had already passed, but Anna decided to revisit the places she had been to with Elsa.

She went to the wreckage of Elsa's home before anywhere else.

It was strange how well she remembered the path; Anna had never considered herself good with directions, but for having been there only once, she navigated the isolated, mountainous path with surprising expertise. It was the same way with all her memories of Elsa, though. She remembered everything down to the last detail, every word, every minute sensation. She could never forget.

Least of all this place.

Past the outlying village outside the main castle town, and even farther still, isolated homes dotted the countryside like ants on a hill. Elsa's old home lay at the base of a mountain like an enduring scar on the landscape. Even from afar, Anna could see the damage, not just contained to the house but the entire surrounding area. Lightning had burned so deeply that scorch marks still striped the ground, radiating outwards from the house in all directions to form a snowflake.

It was a little surprising that after so many years, the ruins still stood undisturbed. It was as though nature had seen fit to preserve the momentous occasion. Anna approached, somehow feeling like she was trespassing on hallowed ground. Elsa might have had leave to come here, but she, alone, did not.

Most of the snow had melted. It wasn't particularly warm, not when winter was at their doorstep, but only patches of ice remained of the field of snow Elsa had created. Maybe this had been normal snow, melting as any snow would when exposed to the sun. But though Olaf had been born here, crafted from this same snow, he hadn't melted, not even in his inanimate state. Maybe his magic was special. It gave Anna some hope that he would eventually come back.

Anna crouched down next to the rubble, taking a moment to just take in the sheer level of destruction. Elsa had done this when she was eight years old. How terrified must she have been, to manifest lightning and collapse the house, burn the wood into charcoal and reduce the charcoal further into ash? Did she have any neighbors, Anna wondered? Did no one realize that Elsa was being abused?

"I wish you were here right now," Anna murmured. "We should have talked about a lot more than we did. You never _could_ bring yourself to be honest with me."

She was distracted by a flash of color underneath the mound of wood slats and planks. Amidst the dull brown and black, the hint of blue shone enough to be visible through the spaces between the boards. Anna grabbed the edge of a plank and, standing back up, plied it off with one great heave. She tossed it aside. Repeating the process to clear the space, she finally uncovered the source of the blue gleam.

It was an orchid.

Slowly, Anna brushed away the soot covering the petals, digging into the dirt with her fingers to free more of the flower, and she saw there were _more_ sprouts poking through the ashes, just beginning to grow. Were these the flowers Elsa's family had grown? Or were they newcomers, taking root once the area was cleared? Anna rubbed one of the petals between her fingers, marveling at the waxy, velvety texture. Unveined, unmarked, completely blue. It looked almost unreal, like ice shaped into a flower.

"Do you like them?"

Anna whirled around.

And froze at the impossible sight that greeted her, the little girl who seemed to know her thoughts. She only stood there and waited silently, patient smile on her face, while Anna tried and failed to understand what was going on. Standing in front of her was a blue-eyed girl with platinum blonde hair woven into a single braid behind her back. Her face was one Anna had seen, once, in a memory.

"I liked the flowers too," Elsa said, and she began to hum while waiting for Anna to respond.

"Why…?" Anna cleared her throat. She wanted to reach out, but her hands shook too much, and Anna restrained herself with every ounce of self-control that she had. Seeing this child version of Elsa – happy as she never was anymore, not even when they were together – hurt more than anything. She'd thought she could _heal_ Elsa somehow. It hurt to realize she had never been enough. "You aren't real."

"Maybe not," Elsa agreed.

"Then why are you here?" Anna was sure she no longer had the piece of Elsa's reliquary. Nothing was showing her memories. But even if that were the case, she hadn't been able to interact the last time.

"Places like these are special," Elsa said.

"I'm probably going crazy."

Elsa giggled. Just like she would as an adult, she covered her mouth to muffle the sound, and Anna realized with a pang that Elsa had always possessed that habit. It hadn't been a recent addition, not something learned for courtly manners. She never knew. She'd just attributed it to Markus.

"Since you're going crazy anyway…" Elsa grinned, eyes brightening with mischief that Anna had only seen once or twice before, and ran toward the mountains. "Follow me!"

"Wait!" Anna leapt to her feet. Elsa had already run halfway up the slope, but she stopped and gestured for her to follow. Every bit of common sense told Anna that this was a bad idea. Following strange child-version apparitions of people was just _asking_ for trouble…but then again, most things she did were asking for trouble. Anna groaned. "Damn it, I need to stop doing these stupid things. Wait for me!"

While the path began docile enough, that impression quickly soured when the mountain shifted from mere rock to woodland. Elsa seemed to have no concern for terrain, running directly into the deepest part of the forest, but Anna lingered and eyed the route with suspicion. If there was a path, it had long since been overgrown by a twisting tangle of branches and thickets. Trees grew so densely that hardly any light managed to filter through the canopy of evergreen leaves; Elsa was like a beacon, the bright blue of her dress enough to illuminate the way.

"Aren't you coming?" Elsa asked.

Anna cursed her own curiosity when Elsa kept going, practically dancing as she spun past the bumpy road and twirled around stray branches. She obviously had no trouble navigating, but meanwhile, Anna fought every step of the way. More than once she slipped on a stray stone, or had her coat snagged by the thick maze of branches. It was the strangest of forests. She couldn't hear anything that should have lived inside, neither birdsong nor the chitter of insects, and there was none of the damp smell of a forest, only the sharpness of pine. Anna ignored it in favor of concentrating on where she was going.

Elsa always waited for her a ways ahead, hiding giggles at her misfortune.

"Are we there yet?" Anna asked.

"Who's the kid here?" Elsa replied, taking off again.

They seemed to spend as much time going down as up, half the time passing through territory that would have made a mountain goat hesitant. But Anna was determined. Brambles plucked at her arms and legs, ripped her clothing and tore at her hair, but she continued. She had no idea where she was even going, but when had she ever been sure of anything, with Elsa? It wasn't anything new. Her chest was bruised and her body was battered from head to toe, but Anna went on.

What seemed like hours passed before Elsa finally stopped.

Anna hadn't noticed the air grow warmer, but when she stumbled to a halt, gasping for breath, the steam vents became obvious. She could tell they were in a valley of some sort, an open clearing with terraces, but nothing looked out of the ordinary except for a pile of rocks. Anna looked back and saw Elsa's old home at the bottom of the cliff. It wasn't far, actually, though the walk certainly felt torturous. It shouldn't have taken as long as it did to get here.

"I might have taken a few detours," Elsa admitted, looking down and picking at the bottom of her dress. When Anna didn't say anything, she abandoned her show of repentance and grinned. "Sorry! I just like spending time with you, I had fun."

"You were a _brat_, Elsa," Anna said, but she grinned back and reached out to pat the girl on the head.

Her hand passed right through.

Anna jerked away, but her shock faded into acceptance soon enough. She shouldn't have expected anything different. Elsa was not this child anymore. Elsa had grown up and become queen of the Southern Isles, wiped away all of her past so that none of this remained.

"Why'd you bring me here?" Anna asked quietly.

"You'll see," Elsa said. She stepped backwards into the clearing, keeping her wide blue eyes on Anna. Her grin was replaced by a somberness that didn't belong on her face, the face of a child. Suddenly, Anna thought, she resembled the grown-up Elsa. "Just promise not to forget me again."

"Again?"

But before Anna ever got an answer, Elsa disappeared. She was left alone in the valley, surrounded by rocks and nothing else. What was the point? Was there ever a point at all? No matter which Elsa she was dealing with, they were always the same. Anna kicked the ground and slumped down next to the rocks, holding her head in her hands. She didn't know what she had been expecting. She wondered, now, if she had really seen that child, or whether she just missed Elsa _that_ much–

She was interrupted by rumbling.

Anna scrambled to her feet, watching openmouthed as the stones quivered in place and then began to roll into formation towards the center of the clearing. One came close to trampling her feet, and Anna jumped aside with a yelp, eyeing the rest as they approached. Over a hundred boulders congregated in the center, arranged in several rings with Anna in the middle. She felt oddly…scrutinized.

By rocks.

"Today just cannot get any weirder…"

And that was when one of the stones unfurled itself into a little fat man complete with cape.

Anna shrieked. She took it back. She wasn't going to be surprised by anything anymore. She was going to run, pack her bags, and find herself a nice place to relax because obviously, the stress was getting to her head. When she started calming down and noticed the stone-man wincing, though, she felt guilty. It couldn't have been pleasant listening to her scream. Could stone-men hear anything? It had ears…

"Umm, I'm sorry," Anna said.

She had a second shock when the stone-man smiled, revealing pearly white teeth – Anna decided she didn't need to know how that worked – and said, voice deep like grating boulders, "It's quite all right. But are you sure you don't recognize what I am, Anna?"

"Oh, I-I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like…you?" Anna took a closer look anyway, words trailing off when she noticed that the unfurling stone-creatures, with their stout humanoid features and bright smiles, rather resembled something out of the folktales she had been told as a child. It was with awe and childish wonder that she exclaimed, "Trolls! I didn't know you guys really existed!"

"Indeed! You may call me Pabbie."

Chuckling, Pabbie gestured all around him.

"Welcome, Anna, to the Valley of the Living Rock."

* * *

All the princes were gathered outside Edmund's room, having waited in silent vigil for the greater part of the day. After Edmund fell unconscious, Elsa had rushed him to Saul. Markus was nowhere to be seen; Elsa had delivered the news earlier and the man said nothing, only waved her away with such a drained, resigned motion that Elsa barely recognized him as Markus. Now, Saul finally emerged from Edmund's room. Elsa knew already from the stiffness of his features that there had been little progress.

"What's wrong with him?" Elsa asked.

"I've never seen or heard of anything like this before," Saul said, and mingled fascination and frustration in his voice. Saul never did like enigmas he couldn't figure out. "It's almost like he's been poisoned, but slowly, over the last _decade_ or more."

Fabian frittered like an old housemaid at the mention of poison, demanding to know more, but Elsa cut him off with a dark stare.

Saul continued, "Frankly, I've taken a look at him before and noticed this same problem. I originally believed the damage was residual from what the Sorcerer did. Or, I suppose, what Gustaf did."

"But it is not?" Elsa asked.

"No," Saul said, frowning again. "I don't even understand how he's been up and about for so long."

"Could this be inherited from Markus?"

"Father's illness comes from old age and trauma from his battles, exacerbating a defect in his lungs," Saul said. "Whatever affliction Edmund has? It's completely ravaged all of his body. Judging from the state of his body…Edmund should have died a long time ago."

Elsa's gaze flickered to the door, and she could almost imagine the boy lying prone on his bed, weak and helpless, his normal energy replaced by the silence of sickness. None of this made sense. Edmund had been healthy just days ago, just _hours_ ago. She had never once even seen him sick with the common flu before this, and to be told that he should be dead? No. Edmund would live. Edmund _had_ to live.

"There must be something you can do," Elsa said again.

"It would help if I knew what was wrong with him. Well, the closest thing I've seen would be…" Saul clamped his mouth shut, face paling so suddenly that it seemed the blood had drained out of his body.

"What?" Elsa asked.

"It's nothing," Saul said quickly.

Was it that bad? Some incurable disease, perhaps. Elsa waved the others away and they departed, some grateful for the reprieve, others genuinely concerned. She pushed the door open and walked closer to the one brother who openly accepted her as family. Edmund did not lie prone as she imagined. Instead, he writhed in constant pain, skin cracking and splitting apart. When he noticed her approach, his eyes flew open and fixed her with a glassy, bloodshot gaze.

"_Get away from me!"_

"Edmund–?" Elsa stepped closer and laid a hand on his shoulder, but the boy immediately shook her off and curled up into fetal position. "Are you…all right…?"

"Get away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away," Edmund muttered, and that was when Elsa realized – Edmund wasn't awake. "I'm running out of time, I need more time, I need more light!"

Elsa backed away and let him rest.

She needed to tell Markus.

It was her intention to head to the throne room, where Markus often deliberated. Elsa strode through the long hallway of the princes' wing, passing each and every one of their rooms, and just when she was about to reach the end, she noticed that the door to the first was slightly ajar. Nobody was supposed to be here. Elsa carefully pushed it open another crack, and she peered through.

Markus was standing in Gustaf's room, clutching one of the bedposts. Elsa could not understand. Markus was staring into nothingness with an utterly broken expression, holding the post so tightly, leaning so heavily and admitting such _weakness_ as he never did, as though his whole world had collapsed and he needed that support. She pushed the door open slowly, so the creak would alert him.

"Markus," Elsa said, "Edmund is not recovering."

"I know," Markus said. "But nothing can be done."

"How can you know?"

Markus said nothing.

"I believe there is a way," Elsa said, and Markus turned. "If the Mirror is powerful enough to fix me, and to cure your illness, then perhaps, for Edmund, also…?"

"…Yes," Markus breathed. "Of course."

Markus leaned away from the bedpost, and his gaze flickered to the portrait of Celina for a brief, brief moment. Such distaste passed over his features that Elsa vaguely wondered if he might set fire to the painting, but the moment passed; Markus looked once more at the empty bed, at the room that had once belonged to Gustaf, and he strode out with a tight nod at Elsa.

"It's time to begin, then."

Time to complete the Mirror.
