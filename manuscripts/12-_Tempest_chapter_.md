**Chapter 12: Puppeteer Behind Shadows**

Anna was safe and that was what mattered, but Tobias…

"Come to see me rot?"

Elsa peered through the bars of his jail cell to see Tobias sitting chained on the ground, his remaining hand lying tauntingly lax over his bent knee. She noted that his hand had been completely braced in a steel glove so that it was no longer even visible. Just a precaution in case he did learn magic through his forays into the deeper, darker parts of the libraries, but with Elsa standing vigil he could hardly escape. Even without her, though…

"I doubt that is necessary," Elsa said, nodding at his restraints. "You do not strike me as having any magical ability, or back at the tower you might have saved yourself without my assistance. If I'm not wrong, you spread the rumors yourself."

"Astute." Tobias rattled the brace, chuckling quietly as the chains rankled. "Reputation can get you far, but I'm sure you know all about that, Elsa."

"…What are you trying to say? Elsa asked. "Speak in riddles again, and I promise you the pain of your severed hand a thousandfold."

Tobias looked up, eyes alight with mad frenzy, and he shot forward so suddenly even Elsa nearly flinched back. His gloved hand slammed against the bars. The shackles no doubt strained painfully against his ankles, but he ignored them in favor of snarling across the gap.

"Brave words, from someone who can't even control her own reliquary."

Frost snaked across the ground and up the stone beams, but Tobias only looked ever more delighted by her reaction. Elsa reined in her emotions and the ice halted, but the damage was done. It was as good as confirmation and they both knew it, especially when her control was too tenuous to even recall the ice. Tobias retreated and slumped against the wall.

"How did you know?" Elsa asked. "And of the reliquary in the first place. Markus created the concept, and he would never have left record of it anywhere."

"You aren't the only one he graced with the knowledge of it," Tobias laughed.

"…You?" As far as Elsa knew, Markus never favored Tobias. But she could not imagine him bequeathing the knowledge to any of his sons; Markus had _warned_ her against most of them. Elsa had been his heir, and she alone was taught by Markus personally. So then, who…?

"Like you said, I possess no magical talent." Tobias sobered, eyes shadowed and haunted, his laughter vanishing into thin air as his lips pursed into a thin line. "Why are you here, Elsa?"

"Curiosity." Elsa bent down on one knee and stared him in the eye, watching as he arched an eyebrow in surprise. "I want to know why it is that you did what you did. Not for your sake specifically, but…I don't understand. I have done all that I can for this kingdom."

"You cannot be serious."

Elsa tilted her head in question.

Tobias snorted and put his head back, quietly chortling to himself with eyes closed. "Father mutilated you beyond recognition if you cannot understand. I'm almost sorry for you, Elsa, I truly am."

"What did I say about riddles?"

"Of course, I remember," Tobias said, holding up his hand in jest. "There isn't always a reason, Elsa. It is base human nature to seek power, and if you were expecting some grand ideal from me, I have nothing to offer you. There is no great revelation. I am a human being, so I am greedy and deceitful. Expect the same betrayal from everyone around you."

"I don't believe that," Elsa said. As she spoke the image of a single person came to mind. Not Markus, as she might have expected, and perhaps it would have been, any time before this. But now…she thought of another. There was just one person she trusted.

"Your pet?" Tobias laughed again, body vibrating so that the chains rattled in time with his wheezy chuckle. "Ahh. You did choose well; I should tell you how she tried to stop me even while she was dying. Her name is Anna, correct? How is she now?"

"Better than you."

Tobias nodded. "What she deserves, then. Interesting girl, but I'll warn you all the same, Elsa. It's always the one you trust. Let your guard down, and the betrayal will only be deeper."

"Are you speaking from experience?" Elsa asked.

Tobias cracked an eye open, staring at her from under the cover of his hair and blinking slowly. "Astute as always. You won, Elsa, and despite everything, you did save me," Tobias murmured. Bracing his elbow against the wall and pushing off the ground, his glove scraping with a dull metallic screech against stone, he sat up. "I feel that I owe you this information at least. I did not work alone. There is another."

"And this person knew about the reliquary?" Elsa narrowed her eyes. "Who is it?"'

Tobias opened his mouth to answer.

He never had the chance to finish.

Because the moment he started to speak, he released only a glut of blood when his throat caved in.

For a moment, even Elsa was too stunned to move. By the time her senses returned and she thought to scan the cell for whatever might have caused it, to stop whatever it might be, she saw nothing. It was as though an invisible hand had simply crushed his throat; Tobias released a single choked scream before even that silenced, windpipe ruined. Dark runes branched across his face as he writhed helplessly, spidering over his sallow skin like veins of blackened blood.

"H-H–" Tobias keeled over, clutching his chest and convulsing. Even his raspy whisper left him, but with great force of will he raised his head.

Elsa could see the pleading in his eyes, but she could do nothing. She had no way of stopping this. Elsa stood and stepped away as Tobias began bleeding from his eyes, his nose, his ears, as his mouth stretched open in a soundless scream.

She watched as Tobias died, bringing the secret to his grave.

* * *

A messy business.

Elsa only managed to retreat to her room hours later, after handling the aftermath and arranging for a quiet burial. She mulled over the mysterious death but could find no concrete answers, only theory upon theory generated by a restless mind. All other thoughts left her mind, however, when she saw Anna still waiting for her. Maybe the shock of everything that had happened was too much for her to rest. It certainly was for Elsa.

"Is something wrong?" Anna asked suddenly.

Elsa was so surprised she almost forgot to close the door behind her, but then she realized Anna would, of course, be able to tell. In Anna's heart lay a shard of her reliquary, and it had allowed her to see the memories she buried with it. It was not so surprising that Anna would be attuned to her thoughts now.

Strangely, the idea was not displeasing.

"It's nothing," Elsa said, her response entirely on reflex.

"…Okayyy." Anna blinked, frowning down into the cup of hot tea she cupped in her hands. After a moment, she shrugged. She pat the spot next to her in bed, and Elsa finally noticed that Anna had invited herself into _her_ bed. "So are we going to talk about what happened at all?"

Elsa pulled up a chair and sat at the bedside instead, barely holding in her smile when Anna pouted. "I think that would be best. As I'm sure you know…"

"I have a piece of your heart," Anna finished. She held up a single strand of white hair that remained, entirely bleached from root to tip. "Is this normal?"

"I don't know," Elsa admitted. "Nothing like this has happened before."

"Does it look bad?"

"No."

"You answered too quickly! That means you didn't even think about it–"

"And if I had thought about it, you would have said I hesitated," Elsa said. When Anna grumbled under her breath, Elsa smiled. "You look beautiful."

Anna stilled, and for a moment Elsa wondered if she had been too direct; but then she saw Anna redden and burrow her face into her tea, guzzling it down with gusto, and she became even more confused. Truthfully, many of Anna's quirks confused her. Anna resurfaced, looking just a bit calmer.

"You look beautifuller!" Anna said, but then she gaped and added, "Not fuller, I don't mean you look _fuller_, but more, more beautiful."

Elsa tried her absolute hardest to hide her chuckle, even going so far as hide behind her hand and pretend it was a cough. It was such a _banal_ sort of excuse she immediately regretted it, but Anna brightened all the same and giggled along. Elsa listened to the sound and thought maybe being able to laugh wasn't such a bad thing, if Anna enjoyed it.

"Your laugh is cute," Anna blurted out.

"…I'm sorry?"

Elsa watched as Anna gaped, dove into her mug, and took another overly-large gulp of tea before resurfacing. The tips of her ears glowed bright red. She was rather tempted to reach out and touch the warmth. "Can we talk about something besides how socially awkward I am?" Anna asked. "Please?"

They made quite a pair, Elsa thought. One of them socially awkward, and the other emotionally impaired.

She must have voiced the thought without realizing it. Anna flushed _again_ – Elsa wondered about that strange tendency – and all but shrieked, "A-A pair? What do you mean by a pair?"

"We are two people," Elsa said slowly.

"Oh. Right." Anna cleared her throat, looking to and fro and anywhere but Elsa. Barely a moment after, she paused and burst out, "Hey! Were you just being _sarcastic_? I didn't know you could even do that!"

"And I didn't know I could smile half as much anymore," Elsa said, feeling her lips once again pull upwards involuntarily. "All of the emotions I thought muted have been returning."

_Because of you._

"That's a good thing," Anna said.

Was it? She had missed this, being able to feel, without realizing just how much. How could she appreciate what she had repressed? It was a strange, ironic thing. She had discarded feeling, and by doing so lost the ability to even regret it. But now that it returned, just a little…

It was relief and agony all at once. She could see she was so much less now than what she was, less than whole, like a painter gone blind or a composer gone deaf, a storm without thunder. She could remember what a life with emotion had been like, but the emotion she could touch was only a memory. Would it be better to be completely empty than have just this faint reminder of what she lacked?

Easy enough to make her decision.

"…It's a good thing," Elsa admitted.

Anna smiled widely, and Elsa knew she made the right choice.

* * *

A small part of her had been afraid Elsa would say otherwise, but hearing her agree…

Well, Anna was happy to say the least.

"So!" Anna leaned back against a pillow and asked, "Did you do something to save me? I remember feeling really, really cold, and I was actually starting to freeze…"

Elsa shook her head. "I don't have the control to remove the shard. I suspect the Mirror might have played a role, but I'm not certain. The process just…reversed."

"Do you know why the Mirror, uhh, _resonates_ with you?" Anna asked. When Elsa replied in the negative, Anna scowled and mumbled, "Well, that guy basically told you nothing."

"The Mirror may be beyond even Markus to fully comprehend, but if he knew why, I'm sure he had reason to withhold the information from me."

Elsa stated it so factually, like even the possibility of anything otherwise was unimaginable; Anna might have believed her if she hadn't seen the memories for herself. There was something off about Markus, Anna was sure of it, but questioning his motives now wouldn't help anything. All it would accomplish was push Elsa away.

"If you say so," Anna said. Before Elsa could comment on the thinly veiled skepticism, she added, "So I was thinking, I'm not going to have powers or anything right? Not going to lie, that would be sort of maybe fantastic, but then I think of Tobias and...? Ick, I'm not like that."

"It's unlikely. What Tobias wanted to accomplish was very different," Elsa said, and Anna exhaled a long breath. "He was trying to wrest control of my reliquary from me, but it was not unprotected. You saw? Unthawing ice surrounds it, forever. But as for you…when you touched it…"

"A piece of it actually went with me." Anna blinked. "Huh. I guess you just like me more then."

Elsa smiled and was just about to respond when a loud knock on the door interrupted. Before either of them could answer, Alek came bursting through the door, looking nigh-murderous and followed by an apologetic Saul. When Alek caught sight of Elsa, he stalked over with such obvious violent intent that Anna instinctively shrank back.

"You're making a scene," Elsa said, tone frigidly imperious once more as she rose to her feet. Despite the height difference, she tilted her chin upwards and stared down at Alek while he glowered. Anna was once again struck by the difference between the Elsa she knew and the Elsa everyone else saw.

Now that she realized just why her cold mask looked so natural, Anna felt a throb at her heart.

"My apologies–" Saul began, but Alek cut him off with a snarled, "Why is Tobias dead?"

"Tobias is dead?" Anna asked.

Alek looked over and finally seemed to notice her, eyes flaring wide and jaw tensing so strongly Anna could see muscles straining. And then she remembered the rumors, what Alek thought was going on–

"Whoa! This is not what it looks like!" Anna said, flinging the covers away and clambering to her feet. "Look, no perverse whims and whatnot. Calm down."

Elsa frowned, seemingly confused, but that was probably for the best considering what nearly happened with Andersen. Anna quickly nestled between Elsa and Alek, pushing them both away from each other. Both of them were obviously too strong for her to move, but they acquiesced. Feeling emboldened, Anna put on her best stern face and fixed them both with what she thought was a deadly glare.

"Are you two ready to calm down and talk this out?" Anna asked. Elsa tilted her head questioningly but nodded, slowly, and Anna turned to Alek. Face souring, he nodded too. Behind them all, Saul watched with obvious disbelief, his eyes fixed on Elsa.

"How did you…?" Saul cleared his throat. "Well, I apologize again. I told Alek to wait before barging in here, but when the news came out…"

"I want an explanation," Alek growled.

"I saw Tobias a few hours ago, and he was still a smug prick," Anna said. Although, come to think of it, she really had no idea what happened to him. "Are you sure he's dead?"

"I was there," Elsa answered. Anna quite nearly facepalmed at the blatant disinterest in her tone, like they were discussing the weather and not a death. She couldn't even blame Alek for bristling.

"I care nothing for Tobias, but he was still my brother. First Alvard, and now Tobias? How many of us do you plan on killing?" Alek moved to step forward again, looking ready to shove Anna out of the way if it meant getting at Elsa, but Saul grabbed him and held him back.

"I didn't kill him."

Alek barked out a laugh. "And you expect me to believe you?"

"Look, give her a chance to talk," Anna chided. When Alek fell silent with a huff, she turned to Elsa pleadingly. "And can you please just…be a little nicer about this whole thing?"

Elsa remained silent, and for a moment Anna thought Elsa would refuse. She could understand why. Yielding to the requests of a prisoner of war probably wasn't going to reflect very well on her authority, and Anna doubted Elsa was used to doing things any way but her own. But after a long, tense silence, Elsa closed her eyes and sighed.

Out the corner of her eye, Anna saw Saul frown.

"I did not kill Tobias," Elsa said slowly. "Even despite his transgression. It would have been well within my right after his attempt at treason, but I did not."

"…Treason?" Alek asked.

"Yeah, he left me for dead up in the tower too!" Anna shut her mouth but the damage was done. From the way Elsa was rubbing her temple, she assumed that was a little too much information.

"You were in the tower?" Saul asked quickly. "What happened in there?"

"That is none of your business," Elsa retorted. Saul drew back, looking stricken, and Elsa gave pause. She opened her mouth, as though about to apologize – Anna could feel a bit of guilt in a detached sort of way, and she knew its source was Elsa from across their link. Elsa said nothing, then turned back to Alek. "As for Tobias, I don't know who killed him, but I know how."

"Fine, I'll listen," Alek said. "But if I find out you're lying…"

"Know your place. I have no need to lie to appease you," Elsa said, and Anna winced at the overly-confrontational tone. Still, Alek didn't say anything. It was true, anyhow. "Tobias mentioned another conspirator. Just as he was about to reveal his identity, a seal activated and silenced him."

"Are you saying someone else knows magic?" Saul asked, obviously skeptical.

"A likely story," Alek scoffed. "You are the only one here with those accursed powers, and everybody knows it. Do you have any proof, then, of this so-called magic?"

Magic. Anna flung her hand in the air and waved it about, an epiphany striking so strongly the air was almost knocked out of her chest. "You've seen it too! When I was at the library, you remember how I fell? It wasn't me being clumsy, I couldn't have thrown myself back five feet; I was listening in and something pushed me away!"

Alek frowned. "That could have been Tobias–"

"Tobias did not wield magic," Elsa said.

"And I heard someone in there," Anna said. "I thought he was talking to himself but what if he was talking to that other person?"

"Many people talk to themselves while at study, whether to vocalize difficult concepts or otherwise," Saul pointed out. "And what more, none of us have ever shown any hint of the gift–"

"I believe Anna," Elsa said. Saul quieted, face completely blank; but Anna could tell he was struggling to bite back his words, and his gaze flicked over to her before gazing down. "And it collaborates with what Tobias told me. If you require more proof, Alek, I suggest you dig up his body and look at the runes."

"…I trust Anna too." Anna grinned, but Alek only took a deep breath with his eyes closed, then exhaled heavily as someone might before walking to the gallows. "It seems that I owe you an apology, Elsa. As Captain of the Guard, I'll make it my priority to find this killer."

Alek had bitten the apology out so painfully even Anna thought he sounded like he found his own words distasteful, but Elsa nodded.

"But make no mistake," Alek continued, grudging tone slipping back into a much gruffer voice while he glowered at Elsa, "I will still avenge Alvard."

"Then you really should make it a priority to find Tobias's killer."

None of them understood, but Anna felt a hint of quiet satisfaction from Elsa, the sort of triumph when finally reaching the answer to a long-elusive question. Confusion clouded Alek's eyes, but the subject of Alvard was unmissable. While he was as distrustful as ever, he asked, "What are you saying this time?"

Elsa raised an eyebrow. "You should know your brother best. You didn't think it strange that Alvard, who was always talking about protecting the innocent, would choose to fire at Anna?"

Anna winced when Alek seemed struck dumb for a moment, lips parting soundlessly. Then he whirled towards her and demanded, "Is that true?" Before Anna could answer, Alek shook his head furiously. "But Alvard couldn't have – I don't believe it. You didn't say anything when we met. I remember that, so Elsa has to be lying–"

"She's not," Anna whispered, and at her words Alek staggered back with wide eyes. He looked lost, all his fire quelled so suddenly it left him unbelievably vulnerable. It was as though he could barely stay on his feet; Saul helped him to a seat and Alek all but collapsed, head bowed and eyes downcast.

"I didn't – I didn't realize–"

"There's no need for that," Elsa said, and Alek's head snapped up. "Alvard might have pressed the trigger, but it wasn't his will. I was always confused before, but it makes sense now. Whoever cursed Tobias was using Alvard too. Or…to be more accurate, sending him to his death."

Alek said nothing.

"Wh-Why is that?" Anna asked for him.

"No one would think Alvard capable of actually killing me, and the fact that he ended up shooting at you makes it even more obvious that assassination wasn't the goal," Elsa said. "Therefore…"

"You think the whole thing was to provoke you into killing Alvard," Saul finished.

Elsa nodded. "Maybe he learned something he shouldn't have. And then this sorcerer placed a compulsion on his mind, sent him to kill me…"

"Borrowing your hand to get rid of Alvard." Saul shook his head. "This is all well and good, but again only conjecture. All this seems too fantastical, who would do all of this, and why–"

His words were cut off by a guttural snarl. Before anyone could react Alek rose and swept from the room, moving so quickly the door swung behind him. Anna moved to go after him without even thinking, but after taking the first steps she turned back to Elsa in question.

"He won't want to see me, but you two should go," Elsa said.

Anna nodded. Saul looked as though he wanted to argue but he bowed and left with her, his face set in displeasure for the first time since Anna had met him.

* * *

Anna couldn't help but ask as they left and walked closer to one of the branching crossroads. "Why is all this so hard to believe?"

Saul smiled, but it was painfully small and quite obviously forced. "I suppose I am grounded in the things I can see and touch. All of this magic is foreign to me."

"You're surrounded by it," Anna said, gesturing with her hand towards the icy palace. "And Elsa has it too! I thought you would, you know, be used to it."

"Yes, but all of this is tangible. Conjecture based on unreliable information–" Saul took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. "Well, I trust you know more than I do. We should split up and look for Alek."

Before Anna could say another word, Saul turned down the right fork. She was left to mull over his words while walking down the left, and she at first bristled over the _unreliable information_ bit. That was an obvious jibe at her, then. Did he really think she was clumsy enough to trampoline backwards for no reason? But then she realized that Saul was _jealous_. All that about knowing more…

Well, Anna _did_. She stopped dead in her tracks at the thought. It was strange to realize that she probably knew more about Elsa than anyone ever did or ever would, having seen her memories firsthand and even now being privy to her thoughts. She knew Elsa as well as she knew herself.

"I wonder if I can…" Anna muttered, and she focused on the thought of Elsa. She could actually feel her. Elsa's presence was far-off but clearly _there_, like a bright corner in her mind. Anna drew away, breathing deeply. She would need to figure this out. Later.

She wandered the halls in search of Alek, but he was nowhere to be seen. Hopefully he had just gone somewhere to vent and wasn't doing something stupid. Maybe the thought of the mysterious sorcerer was on her mind, because unwittingly her feet brought her to the library. Strangely, the door was slightly open, so Anna carefully peered inside and saw a bright glow.

But not magic, only flames. She walked in and noticed Edmund kneeling on the ground with a censer, eyes unblinking and unfocused as he stared into the fire.

"…Edmund?" Anna called.

Edmund turned, and his lips turned into an o of surprise. He scrambled to his feet and brushed off some powder stuck on his trousers, but it was persistent and stuck onto his hands so he bent down all over again and smacked his palms onto the ground. Anna grinned when he nearly tripped and fell doing that, but he recovered with a shaky laugh.

"Sorry, you surprised me," Edmund said.

"What are you doing?" Anna asked, looking into the censer.

"Have you…heard about Tobias?" When Anna nodded, Edmund sat down again and pat the floor next to him. After Anna claimed a seat he continued. "I guess I'm holding a mini-funeral for him."

"Were you two close?"

Edmund snorted. "About as close as two male reindeer during mating season." Anna blinked and he shrugged. "Picked that up from Kristoff."

"So why all this, then?"

"Tobias was still my brother," Edmund said. "Nobody liked him much, you know, so I don't think anyone else is going to care or do much for him. So, that's why I'm burning some incense. He liked the libraries a whole lot, I'm thinking maybe his spirit or whatever might be here."

"…Oh."

"Scared of ghosts?"

Anna frowned. "No! I just mean…" She sighed, picked up one of the incense sticks, and fed it into the fire. "Well, I guess I'm sorry for your loss."

"It _does_ seem like you're bad luck. You've been here less than a month and that's two out of thirteen now," Edmund said, but any venom in his words was counteracted by his soft smile. "But it's not your fault, I know. _You_ didn't kill them."

"Do you blame… Elsa?" Anna asked. "Alek did. He came running up and almost attacked her."

"Don't get me wrong! I don't blame Elsa at all," Edmund declared, sounding quite hurried and almost breathy. "I really don't. Elsa is really…perfect."

"…You're not like Saul, right?"

Edmund laughed and shook his head. "No, I just admire her a lot. I guess you could say I think of her like a big sister? I look up to her, I really do – I think she has a lot of qualities that I should aspire to. I'm glad the Southern Isles has her; I can't imagine any of _us_ being in charge."

"I wish she wasn't," Anna muttered. "It's taking a lot out of her."

"Yeah, I know. I remember when we were all younger, and Elsa wasn't so…"

"Drained," Anna finished.

"Don't sell yourself short though. Look outside," Edmund said. Anna did just that, and she gasped when she finally noticed the change. "Yeah, the snowstorm has stopped. I can't remember it ever stopping for the past five, six years."

"You think it's because of me?"

"I _know_ it's because of you. If anyone can help Elsa, it's you. You're the only one…who can thaw her frozen heart." Edmund spread out his arms and lay back on the floor with his eyes closed, one hand cushioning his head and the other rubbing at his temple. "Wake me up if the library starts burning down, all right?"

Anna nodded absentmindedly, her thoughts far away.

"I can…help her…?"

Yes, Anna thought. She knew Elsa best, and after everything she had seen, she knew she had to do this. There could be no one else. She had to be the one to help Elsa learn to feel again.

"That's what I'm going to do."
