**Chapter 43: Truth, To the End of Reckoning**

Elsa had left before she could waver again.

She could not allow herself to be selfish. It was more important that she retrieve the Mirror as she had planned; Anna would forgive her with time. With the snow hiding her tracks, leaving the encampment had been easy. She could enshroud herself in her element and, cloaked by white, was spirited away before anyone had noticed. Now she stood at the base of the mountain, welcomed by a familiar sight.

Elsa eyed her home with some mix of nostalgia and distaste.

Nostalgia, because she had always, on some level, recognized that life had been pleasant once. She could not deny that she had been happy here, once. And more recently, she had been here with Anna. She would always cherish that moment when they played in the snow and built snowmen together. For that brief moment, she had been able to let go of the troubles shackling her mind.

Distaste, because the sight reminded her of her weakness. She thought she'd grown beyond this childish wish for acceptance. She thought she'd outgrown the little girl who craved the love of her parents, but apparently not. Every time she acquisitioned a piece of the Mirror she would, without fail, witness another false vision. Only the delusions of a child. She remembered those times well, and her parents had never accepted her, never welcomed her with open arms. She was _still_ creating an illusion for herself, and the thought sickened her as much as it frightened.

Elsa looked away.

She thought she could see something of the child she had been lurking there, and she needed no ghosts of the past. From now on, she would look to the future, and that future which held her happiness could only be achieved in the Valley of the Living Rock. Elsa ascended the mountain, blasting through the protections that hid the trolls away from the world. Pitiful magics, barely more than parlor tricks. Hiding behind their maze of a forest would not protect them.

Elsa approached the clearing as she did once before, feeling the lava move beneath her feet. She would freeze their lifeblood and make this place a frozen wasteland if they did not give her what she wanted.

"Come out," Elsa demanded. "I will not waste any more time on you."

Boulders quivered on the terraces, one after another, but their motions had a certain reluctance absent before. Had they realized how foolish it was to resist her, then? Still, none of them ever touched the plateau, instead choosing to stay upon the terraces to surround her where she stood. Only one rolled from the top terrace onto her level. Elsa watched with disinterest as the rocks unfurled into the trolls, and Pabbie, always at their front, approached.

"Elsa," Pabbie greeted.

"You know why I'm here," Elsa said. "I believe I already told you last time that nothing you say will stop me. Any remonstrations would be tiresome things only, Pabbie."

"You are not as you were," Pabbie said, and Elsa narrowed her eyes at the pity in his voice. "Last time, I thought you were beginning to understand, but now…you are more lost than you ever were."

"I've found my solution," Elsa said. "When you gave me scorn in response to my need, Markus gave me the answers I wanted. I know how to fix this hole in my heart now."

"Do you really believe that this is the way to absolution?"

"What other way can there be?" Pabbie remained silent, and Elsa barely restrained a snarl at his stubbornness. "Does this mean you will continue to refuse me, then?"

"I cannot hand you the Mirror," Pabbie said.

"You said it yourself that it belongs to me," Elsa said. "You have not heard its voice as I have. You do not understand its desire to be made whole again."

"Oh, Elsa." Pabbie shook his head with an air of sorrow unbefitting of his people. "It was not the Mirror that you heard. It desires nothing. What you heard was yourself."

"…Maybe so." Elsa stretched out her hand. "I won't ask you again to hand it over, Pabbie. I bear you no ill will. I have no desire to hurt any of you, but I will not hesitate."

One of the boulders spun down from the higher ground, ignoring Pabbie's protest to stay away. Bulda unfurled herself next to the leader of their people, features screwed up into an expression of cheated rage. Urgent, somehow, not as judging as last time, only desperate.

"Would Anna agree with what you were doing?" Bulda asked.

"Do not speak of Anna to me," Elsa said, unable to keep her voice from turning into a hiss. "What do you know about her that I would not?"

Unless she had the Mirror to change herself, she could never give Anna the warmth she deserved. Anna was still waiting for her in the freezing cold, because that was _all_ she could ever be. She needed this. They _both_ needed this, more than anything.

"She was here recently, looking for answers because she cares about you," Bulda said, drawn up to her full height as though Elsa didn't stand more than five times her height, still meeting her eyes without fear as though she were not more powerful than she could ever hope to be. "Don't disrespect that girl and do the exact opposite of what she would want for you!"

"I do this for her sake." Elsa laughed, amazed at the troll's audacity, but the sound that left her lips carried no mirth, only a hollow anger. "She deserves someone who is whole, not some mutilated creature, not this _wraith_ who cannot feel anything but rage!"

"Is that true, that you can feel nothing but rage?" Pabbie asked, and Elsa whipped her head around to face him. "How could you have ever fallen in love with Anna if that were true? How could you want anything now, if you were nothing but a shell?"

"I cannot love her as fully as I should, as fully as she deserves."

"There is only one person whom you should love but do not," Pabbie said, and his eyes closed. Elsa was taken aback by the sight of a great tear escaping his stone lids, though she didn't betray her surprise.

"Enough talk, Pabbie."

"Yes," Pabbie said. "One day, Elsa, you will achieve your truest desire. But it will not be through this path you have lost yourself upon. On that day, you will come into your own."

"Do you see the future now, too?"

"No," Pabbie said, "I only hope for the best."

At his words, the rest of the trolls stiffened. Surrounding her with their hands outstretched, the buildup of their magic became palpable, audible as a dull hum that sounded through the air. Many of the trolls had their heads bowed. Bulda steeled herself, though Elsa thought she saw a glint of tears in her eyes.

"You know my power well," Elsa said.

"Though we know our fate…" Pabbie said slowly, "We must stand against you."

Many things happened at once. Pink and purple magic rained down from the trolls, but none of them reached their mark. All their energy collided in the center of the circle, where Elsa had been standing, and dissipated into the ground. Elsa had propelled herself upwards into the air with a compressed burst of cold air, and from her vantage point, she could see the entirety of the clearing.

A blinding flash of white light blazed in the valley and lightning erupted from her fingers. It felt heavy. It was a dense pressure rising in her chest, threatening to claw its way out from her throat. Elsa felt her mouth open in a scream of pain and rage, but she heard nothing over the screech of her magic. She dragged her hand through the air, the torrents of electricity focused into a bolt of lightning, and before she could think twice…

She brought her hand slashing down toward the terraces.

Lightning struck the body of a troll and shattered the weak rock, so that bits of stone ricocheted outward and the rest was ground to powder and nothing more. But the lightning never stopped. It gouged through the earth as it traveled on, scarring the valley. It arced from troll to troll and shattered through each one in a fraction of a second, extinguishing their lives before they could utter any sound. One by one, they fell, their magic drained, returning to the inanimate stone they had once been.

By the time Elsa landed on her feet, all but one of the trolls was dead.

She straightened amidst the silence that fell. Pabbie, looking upon the ruined valley, the ruined lives, turned to her and somehow still managed to smile at her with pity. It was infuriating. She wanted to see him hurt. She wanted to see him angry as she was, rage as she did.

"Where is the Mirror?" Elsa asked.

"Can you not see them?"

Elsa whirled around. All the stone was glowing. What had once been the trolls now shone with an ethereal light, and from their remains, pieces of glass arose.

"All of us here imbibe part of the Mirror," Pabbie said. "We were born after its destruction, not prior, not when tyrants still forced their selfish desires upon its heart. And now, again, those madmen like your dark father would wreak havoc with its power."

"So that's why you refused me…" Elsa stretched out her hand and the glass collected, knitting itself back together to form the shard. "You just didn't want to give up this life that the shards afforded you."

"No, I gladly return what belongs to you," Pabbie said.

"Why?" Elsa asked. "Why does the Mirror belong to me? You've said it many times, but I still don't know why. Speak clearly before you die, Pabbie."

"…Do not so easily abandon your heart, Elsa." Pabbie smiled and opened his arms, leaving himself defenseless. "My wish is that you will see what you wish to see, and learn what you have yet to learn."

"Is that your last word?"

"Goodbye, Elsa."

Pabbie closed his eyes, and Elsa, feeling her hand begin to waver, feeling herself begin to doubt, slashed her hand down one more time. Lightning tore through the valley, an electrical storm that leveled the terraces and ground every boulder to power, shockwaves enough to send a plume of dust into the air that blocked out the sun. Nothing remained. Every hint of life had been scoured away, the green replaced by blackened earth and the cheer replaced by utter silence. Pabbie was gone.

She stood alone.

Glass collected above her palm, each piece larger than the next. It was the largest shard Elsa had come upon yet. An entire quarter of the Mirror had been located here, in Arendelle. With this, the Mirror was practically completed. With this, she could finally–

"Elsa!"

She recognized that voice. She would _always_ recognize that voice. Elsa whirled around, lightning flying from her hand, because she had heard her father, not Markus but Vagn_,_ her father who had given her life and nothing else. Elsa took a step back when the bolt phased harmlessly through him. Vagn looked exactly as she remembered, but also different. Because there was no hate in his eyes, Elsa realized. He looked like he had once, before her powers had manifested. What was going on?

Vagn smiled. When he approached, Elsa wanted nothing more than to flee; but she was frozen in place. After attacking on reflex, her strength had left her entirely. She felt like a little girl again, helpless, weak. Her eyes squeezed shut an instant before Vagn reached her, and she half-expected to be struck, just as she had been, once. She felt nothing, save for a slight chill. She opened her eyes again.

"Why are you hiding here?"

Slowly, Elsa turned around. Before her eyes, the valley melted away to be replaced by her home. Not as it was now, but as it had been, the stout little house bordered by flowers. Vagn was approaching a little blonde girl crouched in the corner of the garden, knees drawn in close, hands clutched close to her chest. She was trembling. When Vagn came close, she flinched away and hid her hands. For whatever reason, the sight made Elsa hurt, somehow, an odd pang that struck the void where her heart had once been.

"Everything will be all right, Elsa," Vagn said.

When the little girl raised her head, revealing eyes with fear reflected so obviously in the ice-blue, Elsa realized the girl hiding away was _herself_ as a child. She hadn't thought about her past in so long that she barely remembered what she used to look like. She drank in the sight, eyes greedily tracing every feature with a fervor that surprised her once she realized what she was doing. Her hand had outstretched without her knowing.

"I showed off my powers in front of other people," Elsa muttered.

"And the world hasn't ended," Vagn said, kneeling down next to the child. "Besides, they didn't _really_ see you doing it. It was just like an odd weather thing. It happens."

_I don't remember it happening like this._

She had been punished. Elsa remembered this well, remembered being sent off to her room without food. Vagn had never comforted her at all. As much as she had wanted this warmth from her parents, she remembered only the pain of rejection. Why was she seeing this? What was the point of this mockery? Elsa took a step back, ignoring the longing that told her to stay. Lightning seared through the apparitions, and this time they faded away.

"Happyyyyy birthdayyyyy to meeeeee!"

Elsa spun around again, and saw her younger self building a snowman in the garden. She remembered this as well. She had no one to celebrate her birthday, so she had built a companion, a snowman that Elmira had destroyed. But in this vision, her parents were watching. Ridiculous. Vagn and Elmira would have never stood for her using her powers like this, and they certainly wouldn't have smiled at the sight. Elsa looked away from them. She couldn't stand seeing the obvious adoration in their gaze, the love that they had only afforded her before her powers.

"Shouldn't you give the snowman a name?" Elmira asked.

"Hmm…I dunno." Elsa rubbed her chin, circling around the snowman as she deliberated. "I'm no good with names, Mamma. Oh, I know! You can name him. Not Pappa, Pappa comes up with weird ones."

"All right," Elmira said, laughing while Vagn threw up his hands. "What about Olaf?"

Elsa brightened. "Yeah! And he loves warm hugs."

_I never named him until I built him with Anna._

But then why had the name come so naturally? It had been on the tip of her tongue as soon as she built the snowman again. As though she had always known his name. Elsa shook her head. What was she even thinking? None of this was real. It had never happened. Whatever magic was going on was probably just drawing from her choice of name to recreate this moment as she wanted it to happen. It was nothing but an illusion, smoke and mirrors.

Once again the world shifted, but this time Elsa witnessed the swirling vortex. When color and light stabilized, the scene in front of her had changed. She was standing farther away from the house now, outside of the garden, and at night. She could walk away. Nothing was _making_ her approach.

Then she saw Markus and she almost called out to him, relieved that he was here to stop the illusion. But looking more carefully, Elsa noticed that this Markus was younger than present-day, and his strength had not yet left him. Just part of the vision. But if Markus was here, then that meant this was the day she…

Elsa followed behind Markus, their steps taking a strangely direct route to her home. Actually, it was strange that Markus was here at all; Elsa could think of no reason for him to be here during the night, and he had found her in the day. She could think of no reason for him to be here during the _day_ either. She had never given thought to what exactly Markus was doing here in the outskirts of Arendelle. It hadn't seemed important. She had just assumed that he was passing through en route to the docks, perhaps after some meeting with Agdar for political reasons. But that didn't make sense. Her home had been so far out of the way that no one ever passed through without reason.

Why _was_ Markus here?

Markus stepped over the railing and into the garden, crushing some flowers underfoot. Elsa followed, feeling an odd unease settle in the base of her stomach when Markus passed his hand over the lock, shadows sifting through, and the door opened. It was quiet in the house. As it should be. Everyone was asleep. Markus crept from the cramped living room to the bedroom, one that Elsa remembered to be her own, and once again she followed.

Her younger self was fast asleep, and she looked so peaceful that it gave her pause. She hadn't managed to sleep that well since leaving home, at least not until she found Anna. Elsa was drawn back to the moment when Markus made his way to the child, holding in his hand a pulsing dark light. It illuminated his face. Elsa saw the rigid lines and, for the first time, saw just how cold his features were, the stone mask that betrayed nothing except for callous disdain towards this child, towards her, Elsa.

Markus had never looked at her like this before.

Elsa opened her mouth just as Markus placed his hand over the child's forehead, and any sound she might have made died in her throat. She felt his touch, too. It was like a squirming larva drilling its way through her head and crawling inside her brain, clamping down on the tissue and yanking things out. She almost threw up at the invasive touch. Elsa fell to one knee, hand clamped over her mouth as her stomach churned and her headaches returned a thousand-fold, with a migraine unlike any before.

For that moment she was both the child and the adult. She was the child feeling the pain that she would soon forget, because every instance of pain was removed as soon as it appeared. She was the adult witnessing the pain, so that she could not forget. She was the child beginning to forget love and beginning to remember things that she did not before, instances of pain brought about by the neglect and abuse of her parents. She was the adult who remembered only rejection, but was reminded of love.

_I was loved –_ _**I was hated.**_

_I was accepted –_ _**I was rejected.**_

_I love you –_ _**I hate you.**_

Every thought of her child-self flooded into her mind, so that Elsa could _see_ the change, _feel_ every twist in the memories. When a memory of celebration became lashes of a belt on her back, gashes tore open on the child where there had been nothing before. Bruises formed on what had been unmarred skin, mottled, red-and-yellow blots that could not have been from the clumsiness of children.

Every happy memory the child possessed, Elsa saw them morph into the ugliness that she remembered as truth, only: What was truth? If she remembered something one way, and the child remembered them differently, then what was real and what was false? Vagn had comforted her; Vagn had scorned her. Elmira had encouraged her; Elmira had broken her. They had loved her, but they also hated her; Elsa remembered both versions, remembered doubles of every memory that were polar opposites.

Collapsed on the floor and gasping for breath that she had once needed, Elsa watched as time fast-forwarded. Night passed, and the child woke feeling fear and paranoia about the parents that had, just the last night, tucked her in with soft kisses. Elsa blinked and she was outside, and Markus was there too, peering through the window. She dragged herself over and slammed her hand onto the windowsill, pulling herself up even as the motion made her want to throw up all over again.

"We'll fix you," Vagn spat.

It was the day her parents burned her hands in the open furnace. She saw herself dragged toward the flames. She remembered this, and only this, as she saw it now. She remembered the heat of the flames and the panic, the desperation, the need to escape. Elsa craned her neck to look at Markus. His hands were alight with a purple miasma, and in this memory, and this memory alone, Elsa could see Markus standing outside like a puppet master, could see the cruel satisfaction in his eyes as her flesh burned. She could see the glazed sheen over her parents' eyes, the madness that had not been there before.

They hadn't been themselves.

They hadn't hurt her intentionally.

"Stop," Elsa croaked. It was all she could manage, past the tumult of memories flooding her head, the dichotomy that she still could not control, but she was certain of one thing.

Nothing was what she knew it to be.

"Stop!" Elsa screamed this time, and just as her younger self released a torrent of lightning, lightning surged from her body and burned through the vision. What she saw in front of her cut in half, like jagged edges of a mismatched jigsaw puzzle. Another cut, and another cut, until the boundaries of the illusion fell away…

Into reality.

Everything shattered and she was left in the Valley of the Living Rock. Elsa hunched over on the ground, groaning through clenched teeth. One hand dug into the dirt and the other into her scalp as she clutched her head, wishing she could claw out the chaotic whirlwind of memory. It was too much, too many thoughts, too many conflicting memories. Not even the compartmentalization brought about by her reliquary was enough to stem the flood of her racing thoughts. She didn't know what was real anymore. She wished time could just stop so she would never have to think again.

But slowly, time did pass. As much as she wanted to avoid reality, the illusions faded away and she was left kneeling there in ruin, waiting for the realization to sink in now that she had seen the truth. Markus had been there all her life. From the earliest moment in her living memory, his shadow had been there, watching her, stalking her steps. Were all of her memories forgeries? How long had Markus watched her from the shadows…? And her parents, what had Markus done to them…?

Markus.

She had left Anna at the camp.

Markus was there.

Elsa dragged herself up, feeling her shaking arms wobble as she pushed off the ground. Her legs could barely support her weight. Every motion rattled her thoughts and exacerbated the headache, sparking yet another throb at her temple. But she needed to get to Anna before it was too late. Summoning an avalanche, the snow under her feet bore her down the mountain.

She looked back just once at the Valley of the Living Rock, and she felt a pang of regret at the sight of nothing but a barren wasteland. Nothing was left. None of the trolls had deserved this. If she could take it all back, she would; but she had always been like this, full of regret, only after the damage she wrought could no longer be reversed. It was the same with her parents, with her heart, with the trolls.

Everything she touched seemed destined to wilt and die away.

Could she really expect the happiness she had with Anna to be different?

* * *

Elsa knew she was too late even before she arrived.

Outside the perimeter of the encampment, she felt such dread that she almost lost control over her powers, nearly careening off the avalanche until she rebalanced herself. There was nothing to suggest that anything was out of the ordinary, but Elsa just knew with a bone-deep certainty that she had failed. She leapt off the avalanche and ran into camp, uncaring that she had abandoned poise. She pushed away any soldiers unfortunate enough to be in her path, throwing them aside with a whip of snow.

She could not move fast enough. Even with the ice rippling under her feet, the snow pushing her along, the magical bursts from her hands propelling her forward, Elsa felt like she was crawling. She felt like she was dragging herself through mud.

She needed to get there soon.

She needed to—

"_Markus! Stop!_"

Anna was right there, lying prone in the snow with her eyes closed, and she looked so pitifully fragile in comparison to the dominant strength that Markus wielded. Kristoff was there too, thrown to the side. Blood dyed the snow red, but Elsa couldn't tell whose it was. And Markus…

Elsa arrived just in time to see Markus seize Anna by the throat, and she could do nothing but watch while her surrogate father lifted Anna up off the ground like a ragdoll. For a moment he ignored her scream, instead taking a moment to study Anna's face. Elsa didn't dare to even move. She watched until Markus finally decided to turn Anna around, his face a careful mask.

"I will not hurt the girl," Markus said, but he kept a tight grasp on Anna. "Why are you in such a hurry, Elsa? Have you acquired the Mirror yet?"

"Let Anna go," Elsa said. Just to the side Markus, Kristoff slowly picked himself up off the ground, and Elsa only dared to divert her attention to him for an instant. So the blood was his. Elsa could see the long gash running over his cheek. When their eyes met, Kristoff nodded and inched his way around Markus.

"You did not answer my question," Markus said.

"I'm begging you, please just let Anna go," Elsa said. She needed to stay calm. Anna was still alive. She was unconscious, but Elsa could see the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed shallow breaths. "I've never asked you for anything, Markus. But Anna is innocent."

Markus scoffed. "Innocent? Look what she's done to you, to make you question me like this. Insolence that I would not have expected from you, my child."

"_I am not your child!"_

At that moment, Kristoff leapt forward from behind Markus. Rather than collide with the king, he instead tumbled through a mass of shadow and collapsed into the snow with a groan. Markus, completely dissolved into an inky darkness, now took the silhouette of a shadowy beast with gleaming yellow eyes and held Anna within its grasp. It stood nearly twenty feet tall, immolated in dark flames, and before Elsa's eyes, the beast grew skeletal wings soon covered in the same black fire.

"I surmise that you have learned the truth," Markus said, his voice a dull baritone layered with a watery double. "After what you've told me of the visions you see, I thought you might…but you disappoint me."

"Just as much as I'm disappointed in myself," Elsa said.

"If you want this girl returned to you, come to the castle with the shard." With that, the monster tilted its head towards Kristoff. "As for any others who would side with the enemy, stay here and rot. If you dare to show your face, then you will be judged accordingly."

After those parting words, the shadow-beast took flight. Elsa wanted so much to attack. She could down the monster so easily, but not without hurting Anna. She was forced to watch helplessly as Markus flew away with Anna, vanishing into the horizon and beyond her reach. Even with all of her magic at her disposal, she felt powerless. She didn't even know who she could trust anymore.

Her judgment was obviously worthless.

"We need to go after them!" Kristoff yelled.

Elsa whipped her arm into his chest, throwing the blond away. Kristoff landed in the snow, hard, crashing so suddenly that his head smacked into the ground. Before he even recovered, Elsa had slammed her foot onto his stomach.

"How do I know I can trust you?" Elsa asked, advancing towards the blond.

"I want to help Anna," Kristoff said, growling. Forcing himself up on his arms and staring back at her without even flinching, he spat, "Or do you want to just sit here?"

Elsa felt her hand itch with electricity, the crackling fury of her magic just an instant away. It took every bit of self-control to stop from driving her hand through his heart. Anything to stop the garbage flowing from his mouth. Who did Bjorgman think he was, to doubt her feelings for Anna? She wanted nothing more than to save Anna. She would do anything to make sure she was safe. But slowly, as Kristoff continued to stare at her so accusingly, Elsa felt her anger drain away. She stepped back, hands shaking.

Part of her was afraid of failing, because nothing else had ever gone right before. She had failed Anna so many times already. What did she have, except for this power that had done her nothing but harm?

"She only has us now," Kristoff said, getting to his feet. "We need to go."

"…Why should I bring you with me?"

"You don't have any reason to. It's true that I might not be useful at all."

"…Are you even trying to convince me?"

"You can decide without me trying to persuade you one way or the other."

Elsa inclined her head for him to follow. If Kristoff wanted to come along, then she would allow it as long as he didn't get in her way.

She promised herself right then that she wouldn't fail again.

She _would_ save Anna.
