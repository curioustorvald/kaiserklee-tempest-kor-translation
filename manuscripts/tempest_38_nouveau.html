<p><strong>Chapter 38: Reborn By Ice and Thunder</strong></p><p>In the midst of the formation of spires that surrounded the Southern Isles Castle, the Central Tower dwarfed all others in height and immensity, jutting into the sky and casting a shadow over the castle.</p><p>Before Markus, the tower had little purpose other than to be a symbol of might, an architectural achievement that was exalted over for a time before being discarded in favor of practicality. It would later become the new resting place of the Mirror, brought forth from the deepest bowels of the castle where it had been buried—out of fear, out of shame, feelings that Markus did not share. <em>He </em>had held only pride, and reverence for old glory. But even then, the tower walls had been mundane mortar, not the diamond-ice that resided there now; Elsa had been the one to recreate the tower, though by accident. As soon as she removed her heart, frost swept over its crests and ridges, spreading down and outwards to entrap the entire castle.</p><p>Elsa ascended the tower, each step bringing her closer to what she had lost.</p><p>She climbed the stairs, half-wondering if they might refuse her entrance. It was <em>her </em>magic and certainly knew her reluctance, more than she allowed herself to know it; but she was allowed. She rose to the top and collapsed the barrier, thinking, still, that this might prove her impediment; but once more, she was allowed. All too soon, she arrived in the tower chamber. Though she had stepped foot there many times, some things still eluded her understanding. Aside from the incomplete Mirror, most details were of her creation: the staircase, the barrier, the chandelier housing her ruined heart. But the intricate runes carved into the floor had been present before her time, and Markus never explained their purpose. She could not read them, but then, she did not care to. Elsa looked towards Markus' sarcophagus, but her gaze moved up, up to the chandelier and beyond.</p><p>With every involuntary tremor of her hands, her fledgling strength faded.</p><p>Elsa hated being close to her reliquary. Seeing the reminder of the person she had been, suspended there, exposed like a torn nerve, oftentimes she saw not her discarded heart but the hanged corpse of her younger self. She—the vision, the thing—was terribly little, and also beautifully, tragically broken. Her limbs were slack, held limp like cut threads; her lips were blue from want of air, opened in soundless agony; her skin was grey; but worst of all were her eyes. They were not closed or even open with the listless gaze of death, but widened, red-veined and bulging with sentient, living hatred, all of it directed at her. Elsa blinked. The apparition was gone, but her apprehension was not. She still felt the tug that her reliquary exerted on her soul. Suddenly she felt horribly torn, and weightless as one disconnected from flesh and blood—as though her spirit would float away to nothingness.</p><p>It was a welcome relief when dark warmth flooded her senses, grounding her to reality.</p><p><strong><em>Purpose.</em></strong></p><p>"Markus," Elsa said, standing before the sarcophagus. "I pray you will forgive me just as you always tolerated my follies before. I was foolish then, and I am foolish now. I am irreparably <em>lost</em>, Father."</p><p>Markus was not truly here. It was only a disembodied presence with her now, an echo of his consciousness. For the answers she wanted, she needed more than a shadow. Elsa stepped closer to the glacial coffin, peering down past the ice to see him. Markus looked just as he did before his entombment, eyes closed and hands folded over his stomach, as though he had slept for hours and not years. She needed Markus to be awake. It was all she ever wanted to please him, to earn his acknowledgement and repay his favor, but necessity dictated that she must fail him this once.</p><p>"Forgive me," Elsa murmured. Before she could begin to doubt, she extended her palm over the tomb and pushed her thoughts and her magic forward.</p><p>Summoning lightning was never easy. It was nothing like ice, whose cold was comforting, whose cold had a certain intensity about it, an enduring life and vibrancy in its dynamic form. Lightning was something else entirely. When the cold twisted itself into rigid, blind rage—<em>that </em>was lightning, fleeting, unfeeling. Elsa did so now, drawing on every bit of cold rage that festered in the empty hollow of her heart. Electric currents surged over the icy surface of the tomb, crackling with untold energy.</p><p>Instantly, Markus pushed back.</p><p>Heat blasted from the other end, devouring the cold of her magic and roiling over her skin like flames from an open furnace. Elsa bit back a scream, feeling blood drip from her torn lips. For a moment she was blind and deaf in a paroxysm of pain, and holding on was like clutching red-hot metal. It burrowed through her palm, seized her veins and <em>pulled</em>. At once, her muscles seized. She felt her magic draining through the link on its own accord, and that feeling—that feeling terrified her more than anything she had ever experienced. It was complete, utter lack of control. She was not conductor but captive audience, and it was unbearable. Elsa braced herself and ignored the pain, funneling more and more power through the link, funneling more and more of her rage, her desperation. She swore she would dominate this magic and bring it to heel. Pressure built in the tomb, and in her hands, until her entire body shook and the tower reverberated with the heavy thrum of magic.</p><p>She wasn't making any progress.</p><p>Only the pain built, the phantom heat threatening to overwhelm her completely. Elsa chanced a glance at her hands and looked away immediately; she dared not look closely at the flesh so blackened it was unrecognizable as her own, burned down to the bone and revealing purple, bloodless veins. Even the most grotesque of wounds could not unnerve her but <em>this, </em>destruction by fire, <em>erasure</em>—no. She couldn't move, or even stem the flow of magic. Was this how she would die, Elsa wondered, consumed by her own failure? She realized now that <em>Markus</em> had never pushed back. It was her own weakness. She couldn't control her magic. Elsa looked up, saw the bright glow of her reliquary; and then she closed her eyes, accepting of her retribution. Justice enough, she supposed. Poetic, even, that she dealt death so often, and here, where she had killed <em>herself</em>, she would die a final, ignominious death.</p><p>…Anna.</p><p><em>Do you want to build a snowman?</em></p><p>…I'm not sure I can do this.</p><p><em>I know you can.</em></p><p>Anna had taught her control. When they had built snowmen, Elsa remembered having let go of her rage, and the feeling that came afterward. It hadn't been any wild rush of power that she wielded. It hadn't been the euphoria of domination or even the serenity of peace, but something in between. An unsteady calm, glorious, frightening, delightful. Something had resonated in her then.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Happiness.</p><p>Elsa reined in her power, thinking of Anna all the while. She remembered the way she smiled and scrunched up her nose, the way she laughed and swung her arms, the way she kissed and the way she felt in her arms. She remembered seeing Anna for the first time as she stared up at her with defiance in her eyes, and seeing that defiance become acceptance and trust. Elsa remembered that there had once been someone who had faith in her, and up above, her heart released a powerful glow to match the sudden light of the Mirror.</p><p>At last, the lightning calmed.</p><p>At last, the ice shattered.</p><p>Elsa collapsed, magic quick at work repairing the damage to her body. Every inch of her body ached. She could barely feel her hands as the cold numbed her pain and mended her skin. Even her head throbbed with migraine. But when she heard movement, Elsa forgot all about her pain and watched unblinkingly. She eased herself to her feet and backed away a respectful distance, but she never took her eyes away from the unsealed tomb.</p><p>Markus had awoken.</p><p>An aged hand burst from within and gripped the edge of the coffin, and rising from its confines, the warlord emerged. Each motion was stiff, clumsy, like those of a newborn feeling out the world. Fingers flexed on the edge, practically brittle, each movement issuing a hideous crack. Markus pushed himself to his feet, stepping out of the ice with eyes still closed, breathing as heavily as one woken from nightmare. Elsa took in every feature of his face: the hollowed cheeks and strong, angular jaw, the thin lips pursed into a displeased line. But Markus looked sicklier than before. Now his skin was an unnatural, ashen pallor, nearly transparent and revealing blue veins coursing underneath; and his eyes had sunken into hollow caverns. When he opened them, Elsa saw that they glowed piercingly blue like hers; and yet, unlike. Molten, like her magic had turned into liquid fire and invested itself in his body. Elsa wondered at the change.</p><p>Heaving deep breaths still, Markus took another step. But he pitched forward; Elsa rushed to steady him, only to stop when Markus thrust his hand up into her path. She had almost forgotten how proud he was, that even before, while sickness ravaged his body, he had never allowed anyone to aid him. Markus seated himself upon the remains of the coffin, and he looked more kingly than Elsa thought she ever managed. She dropped to one knee and waited while he recovered, the only sound the rasping of his breaths.</p><p>Elsa wondered, vaguely, whether or not he would even have an answer. It surprised her to find herself thinking such a thought. She had never doubted him before.</p><p>Markus clicked his tongue, and Elsa looked up to see him smiling softly.</p><p>"Come closer, my child," Markus said. "Or do my eyes deceive me, and you are not Elsa? I raised that child as my own flesh and blood, and I believed there were no formalities between us. She would not distance herself so from me. Am I wrong? Do you abhor me and see me as monstrous now?"</p><p>Elsa did as she was told, oddly on edge. She thought she would be comforted seeing her mentor, her father. But whatever familiarity had existed between them was gone. Markus felt foreign, as though she looked upon not her father but the half-remembered face of a distant memory. Elsa didn't know what role she ought to play, how she ought to act.</p><p>"How long has it been?" Markus continued. He reached out, brushing his fingers against her hair and cradling her cheek. "Last I saw you, you were still a fragile thing; just a little girl. And now in the blink of an eye, how beautifully you have matured! You have become a delightful creature, Elsa."</p><p>"Almost six years has passed," Elsa answered, relieved. Of course she was still unused to seeing Markus. So much time had passed. She ought to be happy, and she <em>would </em>be, once the shock passed. "It gladdens me to see you returned. These past years, I have been utterly lost—"</p><p>"Lost, Elsa?" Markus chuckled, and after one last caress of her cheek, withdrew his hand. "From what I've seen, I would have thought that you no longer required my counsel."</p><p>"I-I don't understand."</p><p>"Tell me," Markus said, and here was the voice of the king, not the benevolent father. "Why have you awoken me?"</p><p>"But I already showed you everything. All these years, I reported everything, and just now, I showed you all th—"</p><p>"Ungrateful whelp!" Markus had always managed to sound cutting despite the rich baritone of his voice. Even harshly uttered, his voice was powerfully charismatic, enough to make Elsa flinch with shame. "Indeed you have shown me much, and I regret that I should ever have trusted you. Wicked child! I see <em>nothing </em>but complete and utter <em>betrayal</em>."</p><p>Elsa dropped to her knees once again, paralyzing fear seizing her every thought. She could not stop trembling, and this, she knew, would only draw greater ire from Markus. He despised weakness. "I-I beg your forgiveness."</p><p>"You should know best, Elsa. I much dislike it when people should carelessly admit to mistake," Markus said. "For what do you beg my forgiveness?"</p><p>"I…"</p><p>She did not know how to answer.</p><p>"Your dalliance with the slut of Arendelle," Markus spat. When Elsa opened her mouth to protest, Markus jerked his head to the side with a guttural snarl. "Hold your tongue! Insolent creature. You do <em>not </em>have permission to speak, not when you have flouted my command and awoken me while I am on death's door! Forget filial devotion if you must, but to repay me with wanton treachery!"</p><p>Markus sprung to his feet, the heavy pressure of his magic flooding the chamber until even the light dimmed and the air thinned, replaced with suffocating miasma. Dark flames erupted in the palm of his hand, and he spun around, hurled them down at the coffin which once held him. What remained of it shattered and burned to nothing. Elsa could see only his back, but she knew Markus was observing the Mirror. Incomplete. Not even two-thirds finished.</p><p>"Your mind has wandered from your true purpose. You have forgotten my lessons and become selfish in my absence, Elsa."</p><p>"…Yes."</p><p>"You will learn again to be loyal to your family, to me," Markus said. "Without loyalty, we are no better than the animals from which I salvaged you."</p><p>Mention of her parents stung more than it should.</p><p>"O-Of course."</p><p>"As for Anna," Markus said, biting out her name as something foul, "I did not raise you to bandy with harlots scarcely worthy to be <em>killed </em>by you, much less be loved. You were foolish enough to bring her here; but I ordered you to kill the wench the moment she arrived, and you, deceitful girl, ignored my heeding. She is inconsequential, nothing but a passing fancy, nothing but a distraction—"</p><p>"No." Elsa remained kneeling, but she kept her chin raised when Markus turned. She <em>had </em>transgressed. She <em>had </em>disappointed him, and she accepted his admonishment without complaint. But Anna was not a distraction. Elsa knew that, with Anna, she had done something right. "I will not apologize for Anna."</p><p>Markus stared back, glowing eyes matching her own.</p><p>Elsa did not look away.</p><p>"What more have you to say?" Markus asked.</p><p>"I shall not lie," Elsa said. "And I am not deceitful. If I were, I would say that I regret my actions, but I regret nothing of my time with Anna. I am glad that I brought her here, and I am glad that I met her at all. Even now the very thought of her brings me as much pleasure as it does pain, but I would not forget either for fear of forgetting anything of Anna. And, Markus, you may think me ungrateful, but I remember how you salvaged me from ruin. If you should so make me choose, I will choose you; I will follow you, always, for the magnanimity you have shown me, but if at the expense of Anna, I will do so and forevermore be a shell. If that is what you wish, you have only to say it. I will follow, Father."</p><p>As soon as she finished, Elsa felt a rush of triumph. She exulted, with the strangest sense of freedom, as if an invisible knot had finally burst from long years of pressure. Now she waited, and watched, as Markus deliberated. Elsa had never known him to be so subdued.</p><p>"You have changed much in my absence." Markus strode towards her until he stood an arm's length away, expression indecipherable. Elsa waited. She could do nothing else but bear his scrutiny and await judgment, but she didn't regret her words, and she kept her poise.</p><p>At last, Markus bent and grasped her arms, helping her stand.</p><p>"You are wise now," Markus murmured. "Forgive me, my child. I was only concerned for your wellbeing, that you should be manipulated without your knowledge, but I realize now I was wrong to question your decisions. Whenever you need me, for whatever purpose, I shall be here for you."</p><p>"I am not wise," Elsa said. "You chose the wrong person, Markus. I have always been ill-suited for ruling."</p><p>Markus chuckled, though the mirth did not reach his eyes. "You were the best choice. Among my sons, there are none who are as capable as you. None who I could trust."</p><p>Many times before, Elsa had noticed Markus speaking of his sons with the same strange disconnection, depreciating but without venom. Emotion, even negative, required care. It was as though Markus had simply given up on them. Only now did she understand the vacancy in his eyes—Gustaf, Elsa realized. Markus must have placed so much hope on his eldest son, only to be repaid with betrayal. How thoughtlessly cruel of her to awaken that memory with her own misconduct! Or, at least, that was how she would have perceived it once. Now, remembering what Gustaf had said…</p><p>Could it be true, that Markus had forced him to create a reliquary?</p><p>"Markus, I wanted to ask about—"</p><p>"Gustaf is dead?"</p><p>It was almost imperceptible, but as soon as he fully registered the thought – that one thought out of the thousands and thousands of memories she transferred over – Markus flinched. It was entirely unlike him. In an instant he hardened his face again, and he was once more a pillar of dark strength; but Elsa had seen the twitch of his lips, the flare of his nostrils, the brief spark of anger in his eyes.</p><p>"You loved him," Elsa murmured.</p><p>"Good riddance," Markus continued, either not hearing or disregarding her entirely. Elsa thought it was likely the latter. "If you had not done so, I would have killed him myself. No, I <em>regret </em>that the chance was taken from me. I spared him once, and he dared to defy me again? Death is too lenient on him. I would have flayed the skin from his flesh and rended the flesh from his bones. Pah! Begone."</p><p>But, Elsa thought, Markus had tolerated Gustaf's presence all these years. Stripped him of his power and thrown him aside, but Elsa knew Markus well enough to know that if he were to kill Gustaf, he would have been dead long ago. Even this transgression…Markus would have forgiven it also.</p><p>"He said…that you were cause for his reliquary," Elsa said carefully.</p><p>Markus whirled around. "And you should believe the words of a traitor more than my own?"</p><p>"Of course not," Elsa said. "It is precisely because I trust your wisdom that I wished to hear it from you, to know that his words were false."</p><p>"Gustaf! I did nothing to him. Gustaf brought his ruin upon himself," Markus said, and then his lip curled. "Or rather, that woman did. My son, degraded into ambitionless waste at her whim! And yet…what an odd story he should spin."</p><p>Markus sounded genuinely confused; his last utterance had not been meant for her ears, and Elsa realized she would hear no more on the subject, no matter how she pressed. It was none of her concern, anyhow. Gustaf had lied, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>"Tobias, Alvard, and Reid have also passed—"</p><p>"Edmund," Markus said suddenly. "What of Edmund?"</p><p>Elsa frowned. "Edmund?"</p><p>"Yes, Edmund." Markus waved his hand impatiently. "Has he been acting strangely? Have you noticed anything about him that suggests duplicity?"</p><p>"Should there be?" Elsa asked. "Gustaf's passing was hard on him, but Edmund is the same as always. Still that same naïve child…but that is his strength, I think. With time, Edmund will heal. In fact, Edmund was the one who encouraged me to awaken you."</p><p>"Did he now…?"</p><p>"In passing, and I doubt he realized it," Elsa said. "He did not mention your name, only that I needed someone who might counsel me. Of course, my thoughts turned to you."</p><p>Markus was silent for a moment, and Elsa could not fathom what he might be thinking. His eyes were unfocused, hazy with conflict; Markus might have had his eyes on her, but he was looking elsewhere. It was the same half-mourning, half-angry expression he had for Gustaf—except mingled with calculation. Elsa realized she held no fondness for that cold gaze. Finally, Markus nodded. "I suppose. Now then, you still have not made clear why you woke me."</p><p>Part of her had wanted to ask as soon as Markus awoke, and yet, now that the time had arrived, she couldn't bear to ask. Having hope was better than being told that what she wanted was impossible.</p><p>"It's my own fault. I awoke you for selfish reasons," Elsa said. "You warned me against the reliquary, and I didn't heed your advice. Now I regret, and I can only come to you for answers."</p><p>Markus considered her with a frown. "You wish to reverse what you have done."</p><p>"Yes," Elsa breathed, reluctantly hopeful. "Is there a way?"</p><p>"Regret is not like you."</p><p>"Regret…has been a part of me for as long as I can remember."</p><p>For years and years, Elsa had managed to fool herself into believing she had no regrets. She discarded everything close to herself, and finally, her heart, so she couldn't even <em>feel </em>regret. Now she stood on the precipice. Having confessed her fear at last, Elsa felt no relief, no liberation. She was entirely under Markus' power. What he said next would either give her hope again or crush her spirit entirely.</p><p>She watched while Markus strode towards the Mirror, hand outstretched to trace the broken surface. Even the jagged ends; but they did not cut him. As his fingers spun off the rim, he said, "With this, reclaiming your heart may be possible. You remember what I told you of the Mirror?"</p><p>"It can…fulfill my desire…"</p><p>And what she wanted most was to be whole again.</p><p>"Anything is possible with its power," Markus said. "Even reversing the magic of the reliquary. But there will be sacrifices along that road, Elsa. Are you prepared?"</p><p>Elsa gazed into the Mirror and saw her broken reflection within the shattered pieces. She had come so far already. Arendelle, Weselton, Corona, all fallen for the sake of this great task. She had once promised Anna not to kill, and she had even spared the trolls for their insolence; but that promise had been broken already. Perhaps it was in her nature. If she was ever going to be worthy of Anna, she would need to break that promise again. Anna would understand. For Anna…</p><p>"I'll do whatever it takes."</p><p>It was just an old path that she needed to take again.</p><p>Except this time, it would lead her to Anna.</p><p>"Thank you, Markus."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Anna had tried everything in her power to wake Olaf.</p><p>She had apologized, begged, promised a litany of increasingly useless things; promised to listen, promised to stay strong, but the snowman remained inanimate. She then resorted to threats, submitting to the fury trapped within her chest and expelling it all with vigor: cursed Olaf for his cryptic advice, cursed Pappa for his plot, and last she cursed Elsa for her horrible, horrible ultimatum. After hours of futile attempts, Anna finally sat down next Olaf and, for the first time in three days, cried. Only when the tears came did she realize she hadn't cried since Elsa left her behind. She had felt numb the whole time, like nothing that had happened was real and nothing that <em>was</em> happening affected her at all. She hated feeling numb. Every sob that wracked her body felt as though her heart were gripped by seizure, but that was at least real and tangible, and like all things real, it would pass.</p><p>She felt relieved, having finally admitted that Elsa was gone.</p><p>Now she just had to figure out what to do.</p><p>She couldn't sit and feel sorry for herself forever.</p><p>"I really am sorry," Anna whispered, but Olaf made no reply. "You didn't deserve that when you were just trying to help, but I-I'll be better than that now, really. So, I'm sorry…and thank you."</p><p>She wished she knew what Olaf was trying to say. But maybe it was better this way, not to have someone to rely on. She had relied on the reliquary for so long that she really thought she knew all there was to know about Elsa, that the intuitive knowledge it gave her had arisen from her own understanding. Anna still didn't know where that shard of Elsa's heart could have gone, but the truth was, without that crutch, she <em>didn't </em>understand. Even that painful ultimatum Elsa had forced on her—Elsa must have known how she would choose. It wasn't <em>really </em>a choice at all, only a way to make her leave. She just didn't understand why Elsa had forced her away.</p><p>Anna walked to the door and took a deep breath, exhaling as her hand twisted the knob.</p><p>"Time to go," Anna said, and she left her room.</p><p>All the maids looked as though they had seen a spectre and examined her without the slightest subtlety, but Anna gave her usual greetings without pointing out their scrutiny. As luck would have it, she found Gerda at the staircase, dusting the same suit of armor in the same places over and over again. Gerda had come in to visit her during her self-imposed exile; Anna regretted how she had treated her now, with indifference that she did not deserve. Gerda had done her no wrong.</p><p>"Gerda," Anna said, clearing her throat, and the maid jumped.</p><p>"Heavens – Princess Anna!" Gerda grabbed her and pulled her close, squeezing so tightly that Anna felt the air being pressed out of her chest. "Have you been all right? No one could understand why you locked yourself up, I've been worried sick—"</p><p>"Thanks, Gerda. I'll be fine. And…I'm sorry about worrying you." Anna pulled away and gave a small smile, the best she could manage for now. "I've treated you horribly."</p><p>"Oh, you—little—rascal!" Gerda punctuated each word with a sharp tap of her duster, and Anna nursed the spot on her arm. "Worry me like that again and I'll drop dead, I promise you."</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>Gerda hugged her again, and Anna smiled into her shoulder.</p><p>"Where's Pappa? I need to talk to him."</p><p>"In his office," Gerda answered, and Anna immediately set off, barely catching Gerda yell, "Princess Anna! What <em>is </em>wrong?"</p><p>She wasn't angry, Anna told herself, Pappa only did what he thought was best for Arendelle, and Elsa had unmistakably subjugated their kingdom. Anna could tell herself that as many times as she wanted, but deep down, she knew she was disappointed. Pappa hadn't been someone who would stoop so low as to assassinate anyone, pretend to be civil and plot to poison them. If he had declared his intentions nobly, even—but would that really be any better, Anna wondered? He would still wish harm on someone she cared about, but—she couldn't <em>blame </em>him for wanting to protect her, to protect Arendelle. Pappa had been dishonest as he never had been, but Anna hadn't been one to so harshly condemn anyone, either, let alone someone as innocent as Olaf; but she had done it. She was disappointed in herself. It didn't make her any less disappointed in her father.</p><p>Anna pushed the doors open without knocking.</p><p>Agdar wasn't doing anything. Just sitting there holding his head in his hands.</p><p>As soon as the creaking alerted him to her presence, Agdar looked up. His mouth opened soundlessly and he stared, pale face drawn with worry. Anna closed the door behind her as Agdar pushed himself up off his desk, clutching the edge while standing half-bent. It was as though he could not decide what to do, where to go. Finally, Agdar decided to circle around the desk, arms outstretched; but before he could embrace her, Anna drew away. Agdar froze in his tracks.</p><p>"I'm glad to see you," Agdar said, smiling tightly, and he pulled his hands behind his back.</p><p>"Yeah," Anna whispered. "Do you…have time to talk?"</p><p>"Of course, I'll always – I'll always have time."</p><p>"Enough to <em>listen</em> this time?" Anna asked again, but she didn't feel any satisfaction in seeing her father flinch. She did not mean to injure. She looked away, breathing deeply through her nose, but it did little to calm her mind. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean that."</p><p>"No," Agdar said quickly. "You're right, I haven't been a good father to you. I spent all this time caught up in my schemes. Even when I had you back, I didn't really listen to what you had to say."</p><p>"I just…" Anna swallowed. "I don't understand what went wrong."</p><p>"Let me show you something."</p><p>Agdar walked to the drawer of his desk and, unlike any other that Anna had seen in his office, opened it with a key. He retrieved a scroll of parchment, little more than a slip that could be held between two fingers, and handed it over. Anna unraveled the scroll – and forgot to breathe. It was her handwriting. Every detail behind Elsa's powers, weaknesses, countermeasures, and the absurd concentration of poison needed to affect her at all, written in her handwriting. It was so alike that even she might have believed that she had unwittingly written this, perhaps in some forgotten fervor. But...</p><p>"You really thought I would write something like this?" Anna swallowed, nodding as though that would somehow help her wrap her head around the idea. "So this is meant to explain everything, then."</p><p>"I should have realized that you would never do something like this—"</p><p>"You really should have," Anna said.</p><p>She crushed the letter in her hand.</p><p>Keep calm. It was impossible to keep calm anymore.</p><p>Think good thoughts, speak good words, do good deeds. Anna realized it was impossible. Her thoughts were vengeful, and her words were hurtful. She realized this and she could do nothing to stop it, but she also <em>reveled </em>in doing harm. How strange, that she suddenly understood what Elsa might have thought of this situation! She might be kind to Gerda still, for she had done nothing to wrong her; but Pappa? No. If people were always kind even in response to that which was unjust, then there would be no deterrence. To be struck at, she must also strike back, so that her oppressor might learn fear of their act; and having learned fear, they would not dare again. Mamma would have said that vengeance did nothing, but—Anna couldn't see that truth anymore.</p><p><em>Is your father to be your enemy, then, Anna?</em></p><p>Anna quieted her conscience.</p><p>"I'm sorry," Agdar whispered. "I never thought that…well."</p><p>"You didn't think I would fall in love with her," Anna finished.</p><p>Pappa looked pained, Anna noticed. Just as she thought he would react once he knew.</p><p>"She's not someone worthy of your love," Agdar said.</p><p>Anna turned around and headed for the door. "I don't think that's something for you to decide, Pappa."</p><p>"Maybe I've lost my right to make moral judgment," Agdar said, circling around her to block off the exit. "But Elsa was, and always will be, a murderer and a tyrant. She <em>took </em>you!"</p><p>Anna stood stock-still in contrast to Agdar's heavy breathing, his desperate breaths obvious in the rise and fall of his chest. Part of her, the part that always empathized and told her to help others, to understand their viewpoint—Anna had wondered if, someday, she would meet someone she couldn't uphold that creed for. She had never imagined that someone would be her father.</p><p>She would not yield.</p><p>"It's my decision."</p><p>"It's not a <em>good </em>one!"</p><p>"You think I can't make my own decisions?" Anna asked, and Agdar stilled. Was he waiting for her to keep talking? No. She wanted an answer. Her question was not rhetorical. "Do you not trust me to make my own decisions? Is that what this is about?"</p><p>"You twist my words. I <em>do </em>trust you," Agdar said. "But Elsa–"</p><p>"You don't know her like I do," Anna said. "And if you trusted me, you wouldn't <em>need </em>to. You haven't seen how she takes care of me. She's gentle, and sweet, and thoughtful—"</p><p>"And she has killed hundreds, thousands of people! Those are the things I know. Have you forgotten already the devastation she brought to Arendelle? Is it really so easy to wipe that all away?"</p><p>"Everyone deserves a second chance! None of that was her fault, Elsa's <em>not </em>like that at all!"</p><p>Anna pushed Agdar out of the way and bolted out of the office. Childish, maybe. She couldn't bear hearing this about Elsa. She had never been subject to this harsh truth before, not when the worst anyone would say of Elsa in the Southern Isles was that she shouldn't have inherited the throne. Now, confronted with the reminder that, yes, their meeting had only been because of Elsa massacring her way through Arendelle, seizing the castle and taking power…</p><p>She <em>had </em>forgotten. Or, at the very least, managed to push the other thoughts away. It was why seeing Elsa kill those soldiers and threaten Agdar had hurt so much. It reminded her of the time she hated Elsa. It reminded her that, despite everything they had been through, Elsa could still be that callous ice queen who thought nothing of taking lives, who was so withdrawn that she considered herself apart from humanity. Nothing had changed. She had hoped for it—Anna had said otherwise, but she had lied. She had hoped that Elsa might change, that she might be how she had been before…</p><p>Before the world had turned her into what she was now.</p><p>Happier memories returned—Elsa playing music, and trying so hard to impress her that she made a fool of herself; Elsa kissing her to sleep, and promising to be there when she woke; Elsa eating bad chocolates, and saying they were delicious because Anna had been the one to make them; Elsa using her powers so they could slide atop the ice and build snowmen. Not to murder and destroy.</p><p>Could they even be the same person?</p><p>Anna was jolted out of her thoughts by a light tap on her shoulder.</p><p>Agdar sat down beside her on the floor of the gallery. Anna hadn't even known that this was where she ended up. Pappa didn't say anything, and she kept quiet too, the two of them sharing in silence. Anna looked up at the opposite wall, eyes tracing the familiar lines of the painting of Joan atop her horse, sword glinting with light. Was that light meant to portray divine justice? She had been a warrior too. But she was a good one, Anna thought. She had fought for things like justice, and peace, and she died a martyr while staying true to her beliefs.</p><p>"Do you know why I always loved Joan so much, Pappa?"</p><p>"No," Agdar said.</p><p>"Because she was the hero. But all those history lessons you made me take," Anna laughed, "I couldn't help but think, you know, Joan killed a lot of people too."</p><p>"She did," Agdar said. Anna snorted when he added, sounding practically compelled to flesh out the story, "Although some historians say that she never really fought. She planned many, many charges, and was there to inspire her men—but yes, many people died in those reckless charges."</p><p>"Not like Elsa though," Anna said, keeping her eyes fixed on Joan. "She's not defending her country or anything. She's the one doing the invading."</p><p>"But to be fair…I was the one to poison her drink."</p><p>"You know she does it so the Southern Isles will have supplies?" Anna smiled, remembering her ride with the supply caravans. "Everything's frozen over, so they can't grow crops or anything. People need those supplies to survive."</p><p>"…I didn't know that."</p><p>"Doesn't make it right," Anna said. Off in the far end of the gallery was Archangel Michael and the Dragon. Glancing at the tiles on the floor, she was reminded of a chessboard, and of a question she once thought she answered correctly. "Wouldn't it be great if the world were black and white?"</p><p>"It's something everyone wants."</p><p>"But things are never that easy, huh?"</p><p>Agdar turned his head to consider her more closely, and Anna returned his gaze. Only for a moment, before she closed her eyes and laid her head down on his shoulder, and Pappa brushed her hair like he used to whenever she had nightmares and couldn't fall back to sleep. She was too tired to cry anymore. Crying wasn't going to help anything. She just wished she knew what to do.</p><p>"Someone else asked me that before, and I thought I knew the answer, I said that the world isn't black and white, but I – I still wish it were, Pappa." Anna took a deep breath. "But I'm not going to change my mind. I'm still going to love Elsa. Even if...those things you said are true. I won't deny them, but I'm not going to lie about the way I feel."</p><p>"...It's hard for me to accept," Agdar whispered. "I just – I have always tried to protect you, Anna."</p><p>"But you can't protect me forever, Pappa." Anna breathed slowly. She could feel the tremor in her father's shoulders. "And this time, what you did. Was it really about protecting me?"</p><p>"...No." Agdar exhaled a deep breath. "I'm sorry. I should have known it wasn't you who sent me that note, but I...I really wanted to believe it was you. People will see what they want to see, Anna. I wanted to free you, I suppose, but I also...I was selfish. I'm sorry."</p><p>"I know," Anna said. "I don't want you think – Pappa, I really am grateful, and I know you love me, but you need to let me make my own decisions now."</p><p>"When you left, you were still a child."</p><p>"And I didn't have you with me anymore," Anna said. She heard Agdar's breath hitch. "I don't want to be cruel, but I was alone. I <em>had</em> to learn. I'm still learning, but you have to let me."</p><p>Neither of them said anything for a time.</p><p>It was...comfortable.</p><p>"You've grown up so much," Agdar murmured. "I'm so proud of you, Anna."</p><p>"I'm still confused."</p><p>"Understanding takes a while. What matters is that you're willing to try."</p><p>"I don't know what to do."</p><p>"You'll find whatever you need to do. You don't need me or anyone else telling you anymore."</p><p>"…I miss her, Pappa," Anna said.</p><p>Agdar pulled away, but he grasped her face with both hands and looked her dead in the eye. Anna had missed this about her Pappa. Now he was <em>there </em>with her, really there with her and nowhere else.</p><p>"I know," Agdar said. "I'm sorry I ever doubted you, I'm sorry I didn't listen to you before. If this is what you want…then I'll support you. If you love Elsa, then I'll accept your decision."</p><p>Anna didn't say her thanks aloud.</p><p>She didn't need to, not really.</p>
