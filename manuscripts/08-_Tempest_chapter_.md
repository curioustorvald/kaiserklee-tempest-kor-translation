**Chapter 8: A Kingdom of Isolation**

Anna spent much of the day shadowing Elsa.

Not that she really had much choice in the matter, since Elsa wanted to ensure her safety; Anna figured after Elsa turning the last assassin into a human lightning rod, the next try might be a little later down the road. But, whatever. She didn't have much else to do, anyway.

But what Anna hadn't been expecting was sitting around watching Elsa struggle through paperwork. Her office was pretty enough, a large space with all the usual bells and whistles: glass bookcases crammed with official-looking things no one ever read; grandfather clock situated against the wall and chiming every fifteen minutes; and an ivory desk finished with gold leaf, oddly situated above a slightly raised dais. Everything had a distinctly white tint. Anna was currently reclining on a cream-colored sofa set embossed with gold, and watching in consternation.

"I don't get it. How come you have paperwork when you're…?"

She didn't want to say dictator. Luckily Elsa seemed to both get the hint and not take offense, eyes moving back and forth as she continued to skim document after document with dizzying speed.

"There are many things I must oversee personally."

"Such as…?"

"Managing the allocation of resources among our territories. The people of the Southern Isles also depend on supply caravans that I have to ration, and all of this has to be done promptly and efficiently," Elsa said. "I cannot do this if I lack full understanding of everything happening, hence the reports."

"Have you thought about a helper? You know, out of the princes. Shouldn't they pull their weight? I don't see any of them doing anything…"

Anything aside from assassination attempts, Anna thought somewhat bitterly. It wasn't entirely a surprise when Elsa answered, "I would rather handle this myself."

"You really don't trust any of them?"

"I suppose not; I only don't trust them _enough_. I've known them for many years, and truthfully, there are those I could rely on." Elsa sighed, rubbing her temple with her thumb. If the growing grimace on her face was any indication, it didn't help. "But it's not entirely a matter of trust. I just…"

"You're a workaholic?" Anna offered.

"I would prefer to manage all this myself," Elsa agreed. "Markus charged me with overseeing his kingdom and so I will, to my greatest capability."

Anna flopped down on the sofa, stretching out on the soft velvet but finding little comfort when she was so irate. "You said it, it's _his_ kingdom. I don't see why his sons get to just leach off of you." Elsa only smiled in response, and Anna knew it was a moot point. "Whatever. So, tell me about them."

"You are interested?"

"In case I run into any of them," Anna said, shrugging.

Elsa nodded. "Gustaf is the eldest, and closest with the second and third princes, Cyrus and Fabian. They have a strange relationship," Elsa said, shrugging. "Cyrus and Fabian can be…uncouth. Gustaf keeps them in line, and enjoys an idle lifestyle of chess and calligraphy."

"Wow, talk about boring."

"…Quite." Elsa cleared her throat. "Tobias is the fourth prince, and very fond of the libraries. Particularly, I hear, of the volumes concerning sorcery. Stefan, the fifth, is an artist. It is likely you will never see him leave his room for months at a time. And…Alvard was the sixth."

Anna wrinkled her nose. "Oh." Not that she didn't feel bad about his death, but…

"Truthfully, Alvard was not without qualities. Judgmental and perhaps self-righteous, but I would not have wished him dead. Alvard was very close to the ninth prince, Alek," Elsa added. "They jointly commanded the standing army and oversaw the castle defenses."

"Not doing a great job," Anna grumbled.

"Quite the contrary. All parts of the castle, save for my wing, are completely safe."

Anna had been thinking about it, and she couldn't imagine how another nation would slip into the Southern Isles, not when ice sealed off the waters. Assuming it was even possible, they still wouldn't manage to smuggle many people. Most the assassins, then, came from inside the Southern Isles. She glanced out the window to watch the perpetual snowstorm, and she had to wonder: Did people here really despise their own queen that much?

"Rafael, the seventh prince, is particularly gifted with music. Very talented, but predisposed to gloom. Eighth is – Saul." Elsa suddenly stopped talking, eyes growing vacant, and Anna was surprised to see her frown. Was this Saul bad news? Only when she waved a hand did Elsa snap out of it. "Saul is close to the tenth and eleventh princes, Oliver and Reid. I believe you've met Edmund. As for Hans…"

"I've met Hans too," Anna said.

Instantly, the temperature of the room dropped. Frost collected even inside the grandfather clock, freezing the pendulum in place, and Anna swore the snowstorm outside grew in intensity.

"…I'm guessing you don't like Hans." Strange, Anna thought, even Edmund said the same thing. Was she missing something? Hans had been a perfect gentleman the time they met.

"There is nothing _particularly_ wrong with Hans," Elsa admitted. "I believe his ambition is shared by many, only he takes the effort to conceal it. It worries me."

"I'm sure you're overthinking it," Anna said.

"Perhaps." Whatever Elsa said, she looked unconvinced.

Well, this was getting uncomfortable. Anna wondered if Elsa was just paranoid; but then she remembered Alvard, and suddenly maybe a _little_ paranoia wasn't too outrageous. What must it be like to be so alone, surrounded by enemies in your own home?

"I'd help out," Anna offered. Elsa raised an eyebrow. "B-But I would probably screw everything up, so maybe not–"

"You are assuming that I trust you," Elsa said, smiling again. Anna flushed, sitting up quickly, but just when she was about to protest, Elsa added, "I do, but I wouldn't burden you with this. You're my guest."

Anna still had no idea why she was here, but the whole tell-me-about-Arendelle thing had to be a sham. Thinking of Arendelle brought a pang of nostalgia and, oddly, guilt. As much as her view of Elsa had changed, whenever the thought of Arendelle came up…

"Anna?"

"Oh! I was – I was just – thinking."

As if on cue, a distraction came in the form of a light knock on the door. One of the princes came in – Anna couldn't yet tell them apart, having seen only a few and talked to even fewer. He was of average height and slender, sandy-haired and fair-skinned, good-looking in an ordinary, gentle sort of way. None of his features were particularly striking, only they had no particular blemish either, otherwise plain if not for sharp electric-blue eyes. Not even sparing Anna a glance, he moved to stand at the base of the dais, where he was forced to look up to meet Elsa's eyes while she sat high above.

So that was why the desk was raised.

"Saul," Elsa greeted, and Anna perked up. Though Elsa kept her face blank, Anna could tell she was both surprised and unhappy to see Saul. Was he an enemy?

"Your Majesty." Saul bowed, only rising when Elsa conferred permission. "I've completed the new ship designs, and they will be delivered shortly."

"And you came here, personally, to inform me of such?" Elsa asked, sharp retort obviously on the tip of her tongue.

"I – I hoped to see you. I didn't have a chance before to ask if you were all right," Saul said, voice soft and concerned, and he made to step forward. Only when Elsa held up a hand did he stop.

Oh. Not an enemy, Anna realized, but the exact opposite. She could see the admiration in his eyes, and his face held such longing it must have _hurt_. No wonder he hadn't noticed her in the room; Saul only had eyes for Elsa. Anna felt an odd pang in her tightening chest, and even her stomach seemed to plummet. Only a moment ago Anna had wished there were someone Elsa could trust, and here was one at last; but for whatever reason, the sight of Saul made her uncomfortable.

"As you can see, I am perfectly unharmed," Elsa said.

"Then I'm satisfied. That's all I needed to know." Saul took a breath, composing himself, and he took a careful step back. Just like that, they looked like any other pair of ruler and subject.

"Is that all?"

"I've also prepared the supply caravan, and they'll be heading out any moment now." Even Elsa gave pause, and Saul's lips turned into a close-mouthed smile. "I wanted to lessen your burden. You know you can always rely on me, Elsa. Please. Just keep it in mind."

"…Thank you," Elsa said. Anna was still reeling when Elsa added, quietly, "I will."

"I take my leave," Saul murmured, turning towards the door, and only then did he notice Anna. If he was surprised, he didn't look it. Giving her a polite nod that Anna returned, albeit warily, he left.

Elsa closed her eyes and rubbed at her temples again, this time with both hands. If Anna had wanted to ask more about Saul, she quickly decided against it. Her curiosity could wait until Elsa was more relaxed, and Anna wasn't sure she was curious for the right reason anyhow. And about those caravans…

"Would it be all right for me to go with the supply people?" Anna asked. Elsa looked up in confusion and she explained, "I know one of the stable-hands, Kristoff Bjorgman, and I want to visit if that's okay. Oh! And Edmund wanted to go? If that's okay too?"

Elsa eyed her carefully.

* * *

"I have no idea how you pulled it off, but from now on I worship you," Edmund gushed, making a show of swooning and almost falling into Kristoff's lap when the sled bounced over a particularly bumpy stretch of cobblestone.

"I don't know how I did it either," Anna said.

Kristoff heaved a great sigh and pushed Edmund away so he almost fell into Anna's lap, but to his credit he steadied himself before that happened. "So now I have to deal with the two of you while I'm working. Perfect, this is what I always wanted."

Anna crossed her arms, and Edmund followed her example with aplomb. "Hey, you're making it sound like we're not welcome."

"You said it, not me." Kristoff pulled back on the reins, and Sven slowed. Peering over the sled, Anna saw a thin layer of slick ice atop the snow, delaying the entire procession of supply sleds. "This really isn't that exciting. We just come out, pass out supplies, and go back."

"Are you kidding? This is great, I barely have a reason to leave my room usually," Edmund said. Anna nodded fervently, thinking of the four walls back in Arendelle.

"So you do this how often?" Anna asked.

Kristoff shrugged. "Once a week, sometimes more if the storm is especially bad. It never leaves, but sometimes it manages to get worse. Somehow."

Anna was slowly piecing together the bits and pieces she had picked up, and just looking outside she could tell the Southern Isles depended on foreign supplies. It wasn't as though anything could grow out here in the barren plains of ice, even if someone was crazy enough to try. Assuming Elsa really had no control over this winter, then…

"Does she only invade other kingdoms so she can feed these people?" Anna muttered.

She hadn't meant for anyone else to hear, but apparently she was louder than she thought. Edmund nodded and said, "Elsa's not that bad, really. She even let Alvard keep his title after…you know."

"Is that a big thing?"

"A huge thing," Edmund reported. "Tradition here is, trying to usurp the throne usually ends with your corpse being mutilated and strung up outside the gates for days."

Before Anna could comment, Kristoff interjected, "Invasion is still invasion."

"But she has a reason–"

"There's always a reason," Kristoff said, and Anna quieted. "Listen, I'm not saying she's some sort of evil witch, and I respect what she's doing, _here_, but look at it from another perspective. You can't deny that she still invades and kills and captures slaves."

That was true, and just as Anna managed to accrue some small bit of reassurance, she was reminded again of bitter reality. Kristoff had hardened his face, and not even Edmund had anything to say about his fate. The rest of the ride was silent, broken only by the howling of the wind, the thudding of hooves on snow and the clanking of wheels.

Once they were in the castle town, sleds slowly began to diverge from the front of the line and ride into the neighborhoods, a few at a time while the rest continued. Once they had moved to the front, Kristoff veered off to the side and down a narrower path with practically snowed-in homes on both sides.

"Just throw the packages to their doorstep," Kristoff said, hefting one of the boxes and chucking it so it landed neatly in front of a house.

"We don't even knock or anything?" Anna asked.

Edmund likewise frowned. "I sort of wanted to see people…"

"Well, they're not always glad to see you," Kristoff corrected.

With that thought in mind, Anna joined the other two in launching packages out. Just as Kristoff had predicted, people came out to take the parcels, but hardly with any excitement; Anna could see the resignation written plain on their faces as they hurriedly retreated back into the warmth of their hearth, but even that was preferable to the contempt from those who lingered a second longer to watch them. With each passing moment this trip was becoming less fun, if it had ever been.

Anna just felt cold, both inside and out.

"I didn't realize things were this bad," Edmund mumbled.

"…Yeah," Anna said back, but neither of them were much inclined to conversation anymore.

Minutes and nearly the entire neighborhood later, they came to one house where, unlike any of the others before, there stood an elderly woman bundled in a multitude of thick woolen cloaks. When she saw them, she smiled and walked out a bit further.

Maybe Kristoff realized how Anna was feeling, because he stopped the sled, handed her a parcel, and said, "Go ahead and give this to her personally."

Anna took it gratefully and jumped out of the sled, nearly slipping before balancing herself. Taking a deep breath to steady her sudden nerves, she felt the icy air burn in her lungs and realized how horrid the old woman felt standing out there. Her nerves weren't important enough to delay this a moment longer, so Anna hurried over.

"Hi, I'm, uhh, here with supplies," Anna began. She didn't know what else to say, so she hesitantly offered the package. To her relief, the woman accepted it and smiled again.

"Thank you, dear."

"A-Are you doing okay?" Anna asked. "I-I mean, I can try and, I don't know, get you something from the castle, or–"

"I'm perfectly all right. Thank you again, dear, you and your friends there. I don't think these old bones would last without you."

"But I haven't done anything. You should thank Elsa–"

Instantly, the woman's demeanor changed. It was as though the kindly old grandmother had been possessed by something dark and ugly, smile twisting into something Anna couldn't recognize. She spat her next words with undisguised loathing. "Elsa can rot for what she's done to these lands." And just like that, she retreated into her house and slammed the door.

But Elsa was the one who organized all of these things, Anna thought, though it was too late even if she weren't rendered speechless. Drawing another deep breath and hardly feeling the burn this time, she trudged back to the sled and clambered up.

"…I'm sorry," Edmund said.

"It's not fair. I don't get it," Anna whispered. "Why do people hate her so much?"

"Didn't you too?" Kristoff asked.

She had. She had hated Elsa so violently the thought of her used to make her sick, had hated her with every fiber of her being. Except now, as Kristoff directed Sven back to the castle and she looked up at the lonely spires up above, Anna wished people could know the Elsa she knew.

* * *

Kristoff dropped her off at the doors, and after she waved her goodbyes, Kristoff and Edmund left. Anna reminded herself to get Sven some carrots. Poor thing probably didn't get much rest, and she doubted Kristoff gave him all the treats he deserved. Not that Kristoff _wouldn't_ if he could, but she knew his ability to procure fresh vegetables, probably more valuable than gold or silver here, was limited.

"Anna!"

She looked around at the call of her name, and to her surprise, she saw Hans staggering through the blizzard, one arm blocking his eyes as he walked. Anna started to jog over, glad to see him, until the memory of Elsa's warning resurfaced. She took a closer look at him, but his smile looked genuine and his eyes were, as always, warm like the green of spring. But still…

"Hans! Wh-What are you doing here?" Anna asked. Wasn't it odd that the thirteenth prince coincidentally happened to be aimlessly riding through the snow to meet her last time, and again just so happened to be strolling through a blizzard as she got back? Would he have some excuse…?

"Glad I caught you," Hans said. Anna hadn't been expecting the upfront answer at all, especially how he laughed nervously. "I-I don't know how to say this, but I was looking for you. I was worried after the news of the assassination, and Elsa's been keeping such tight watch on you that I haven't been able to visit. So when I heard you left with the supply caravan…"

"O-Oh." Anna shook her head. What was she thinking? Hans meant well, and her doubting him like this was petty. "I'm okay! Nothing happened. Uhh, I'm sorry about Alvard…"

"We weren't particularly close, but he was a good brother," Hans sighed. "But let's get inside before we talk. I'm sure you've been out long enough to last you a lifetime."

Once they made the short trek back to the castle, Anna claimed a seat on one of the lounge sofas next to the braziers, warming her hands. When she got too close, feeling sparks dance over her fingers, she flinched back with a yelp.

Hans chuckled and sat down next to her, tapping his boots to loosen some of the hardening rime. "Looks like I worried for no reason. You seem perfectly fine."

"Still clumsy," Anna quipped.

"Still Anna," Hans corrected, and his smile widened just the tiniest bit when she blushed and looked away. "Well. It's been a while since we were here, hasn't it?"

Only a few days ago, but so much had happened since then it really did feel like forever. Anna nodded and looked down, clenching her dress as the momentary delight in seeing Hans started fading away and the disconcerting experiences of her recent traipse returned with a vengeance.

"Is something wrong?"

"Nothing!" Anna put on a smile and raised her head. "So! Why don't you tell me more about yourself?"

Strangely, Hans furrowed his eyebrows, for once looking less than perfect. "You really want to know more about…me?"

"Yeah, last time we spent most our time just talking about me," Anna said. "I wondered if you didn't like talking about yourself so I didn't ask too much, but then I thought, hey, I shouldn't make assumptions, maybe you were just being polite, so–"

"There's really nothing very interesting," Hans interrupted.

"Everybody has a story," Anna replied, and again, Hans looked troubled. "Sorry, I know I'm being pushy. We can talk about something else."

"I don't mean to be rude; I'm just not sure what to say."

"No, I understand."

Hans nodded, smiling once again and looking much more at ease. "But I _am_ sure that something was troubling you earlier. I'd be more than happy to listen if you want to talk."

She had really wanted to keep her whole conflict about Elsa to herself, but Hans was looking at her so earnestly that she couldn't help telling him. "I just wonder what it must be like to be hated and feared by practically everyone," Anna murmured. "I can't even imagine…"

"Being hated isn't so bad. True pain is to be ignored, to be denied even the chance to prove yourself," Hans whispered. Anna looked over just in time to see him jerk back, and even from his tone she could tell he hadn't meant to say all that. Hans shook his head. "Forget that, I'm sorry. Who are you talking about, exactly?"

"Elsa," Anna answered, and Hans nodded.

"They do say horrible things about her. All the servants talk about how she doesn't eat or drink, or even sleep, as though she is inhuman."

"But I've seen her do all those things," Anna insisted.

"Are you sure they weren't for your benefit?" Hans smiled wryly when Anna froze. "I've been here for my entire life and I've also been watching. Elsa simply doesn't eat enough to sustain herself."

"…What are you saying?"

"There's almost always some truth in rumor," Hans said. "And there are so many secrets surrounding the queen. I'm not sure if you've heard, but the uppermost tower…"

Anna made a face. "Elsa's warned me about it."

"There are outlandish theories about it, and Elsa has never cared to explain. If there were nothing worth hiding, then why the secrecy?" Hans sighed. "And this winter…"

"She said she couldn't stop it." Hans looked skeptical. Anna admitted it sounded strange, but she thought there might be something more behind his doubt. "Do you hate her too, Hans?"

Hans stilled, and for a long moment he didn't speak. When he did, his words left carefully measured, and Anna couldn't be sure if it was because he had taken time to consider, or if he was trying to hide his actual opinion. "No, I don't. I understand why others might, but I personally have no grudge against her. But, I would feel better knowing there were no ghastly sacrifices taking place in the tower," Hans joked.

"Is _that_ what they say?" Anna laughed.

"Yes! And that's not even the worst…"

They joked about the increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories, and Anna quite honestly got a kick out of the mind-blowingly creative guesses; but through it all, she couldn't help but wonder.

What exactly _was_ in that tower?

* * *

Time passed quickly, and before Anna knew it, she had been in the Southern Isles for a full two weeks.

It helped that she had an established routine now. Every morning, she woke to find Elsa already perfectly composed and ready to go, having been awake for hours and working on one thing or another. Even though Elsa told her to take her time, Anna always rushed through washing up but somehow managed to come out looking halfway decent, one of the few talents she cherished. They would then leave for brunch, seated at a much shorter table now. Afterwards, Anna stayed with Elsa while she worked in her office.

She was starting to notice these little unconscious habits Elsa had. Whenever Elsa read over something particularly upsetting, she would nibble on her lower lip, and if something was especially boring, her fingers would move into a light rhythmic tap against her ivory desk. If Elsa bowed over too long, this one unruly strand of hair fell over her eye and she would let out a tiny hiss while she brushed it back.

When she heard Anna stifle a giggle one time, Elsa had asked, "Is there something funny?"

And Anna had just shaken her head, finding it even harder to stay quiet when Elsa's face scrunched up into a little frown of confusion.

After lunch, Anna had her own exploration time. By the time the two weeks were over, she had scoured nearly the entire castle. Now and then, she would visit Kristoff and Sven in the stables, and she always made sure to bring carrots for Sven.

"Nothing for me?" Kristoff asked once when Anna didn't bring him krumkake like he had requested. "I do a lot of work around here too…"

"Oh, you do a lot of work? So tell me, how heavy was the sled you pulled around?" Sven whinnied in glee and Kristoff threw his hands up, walking away muttering about traitors while Anna fed the reindeer.

Other days her exploration would be joined by Edmund or Hans, though never both at the same time.

"Edmund and I are very different," Hans had explained, a much more political answer than Edmund's blunt, "I try my best to avoid him."

Of course, she ran into many of the other princes. She encountered Gustaf in the lounge looking incredibly _bored_, and he invited her to sit in on a game of chess. When Cyrus lost, he blamed it on her and Fabian called him a sore loser, and Gustaf just gave her a shrug like their impromptu fistfight was common business. Anna wisely backed out of there when he started flinging chess pieces at their heads and barking out orders to stop.

Contrary to Elsa's prediction, she _had_ seen Stefan, a quick glimpse when he destroyed one of the tackier paintings, muttering something under his breath about it being disgraceful. Edmund had introduced her to Rafael, and she was very much impressed when he composed a violin piece right then and there in celebration of their meeting. It sounded like a funeral dirge, but Edmund assured her that was a good sign. She learned from Rafael that Elsa could also play various instruments, but Anna had yet to muster the courage to ask her to play anything.

"I'm sure she would if you just asked," Edmund said often. But whenever Anna asked him _why_, he just looked away and grinned.

Dinner came around quickly, and Anna now looked forward to the occasion so generally made it there early. Elsa never mentioned it, but Anna could see her smiling as she seated herself. Conversation was usually about Arendelle. If the first day had been uncomfortable, once she got used to the routine Anna found herself unable to _stop_ talking about the home she missed. It helped that Elsa was a very good audience, paying full attention and asking the right questions. She seemed genuinely interested, drinking in _anything_ Anna said about her boring castle life with barely veiled fascination.

And then one day, they got to the topic of her family.

"Pappa's really overprotective, so the gates are almost always closed," Anna said. "But sometimes I manage to sneak out, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people in the market recognize me now–"

"Your father loves you a lot, then?"

"Uh-huh. I'm technically the heir, but Pappa's never made me do anything I didn't want to. Like all those classes and stuff! I only had to take the most important ones, and I know he doesn't mind when I'm all undignified even though I should be poised and regal and – uhh, _royal_, like you." Anna was so lost in memory she didn't notice Elsa growing quiet until it was too late. By the time she knew, Elsa had already trained her face into an expressionless mask, which Anna knew was her way of looking troubled.

Anna could have kicked herself. She _knew_ about Elsa's parents, and she had to keep talking about her own like she was flaunting her happy family.

"…I remember when I first came here," Elsa said. "I was just another commoner until Markus took me in, and I was grateful. I was trained to be, as you say, _royal_."

"Did you like it?" Anna asked softly.

Elsa smiled wryly and shook her head. "I wanted to impress the man who had rescued me, but I hated all the etiquette lessons. I would sneak chocolates, sometimes."

Anna laughed, partly amused and partly relieved Elsa didn't seem offended. "I can't imagine you breaking the rules. You just seem so…perfect."

"I'm hardly perfect," Elsa said. "Can you tell me more, Anna?"

"Sure! Oh, I need to tell you about my best friend back home, Joan of Arc…"
