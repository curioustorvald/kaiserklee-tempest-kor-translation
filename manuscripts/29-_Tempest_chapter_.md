**Chapter 29: No Time, No Light**

It was only a half-developed stray thought that drifted past her mind at first, but the moment she thought the thought, it latched on with a tenacious grip, refusing to relinquish her senses. But Anna had _already_ decided, long before the moment of realization, before, even, the moment the idea had been given words. She had only buried her own desire until now. She felt lighter the instant she acknowledged it at last, as though a weight left her mind and shackles around her limbs had been released. Everything became clearer, sharper, more focused. All her world compressed, linearized, and zeroed in on one objective and one objective only, an all-consuming need that left room for no other.

She had to go to the reliquary and set things right.

Anna set off immediately on an old, familiar path, but somewhere within the recesses of her mind, Anna remembered she had only walked it twice. Once when she first scaled the tower and witnessed the reliquary. Again when she approached Elsa atop the balcony and poured out her own heart. Only twice had she gone along this upwards path, but as her body practically moved of its own accord, Anna had the strange thought she had walked this walk a thousand times. She remembered praying for salvation, desperate for deliverance.

**_Hurry. You don't have much time._**

_Hurry. I don't have much time._

Anna forced her legs to move faster, climbing the stairs and throwing herself outside to the balcony. She could not feel the cold. She could recognize that she ought to, but the feeling of cold that should exist was instead replaced by that compelling urge to keep moving. Nothing else mattered. She would have stridden through a hurricane, flung herself off the castle without a moment of hesitation if that were what it took. Around the balcony lay the tower entrance, and Anna arrived at the familiar crystalline staircase leading to her destination.

She laid her hand on the railing, and just like last time, the air shifted and depressurized. With nothing holding her back, Anna began ascending the steps. Every footstep echoed. More than once. Each one echoed _twice_ and the second time from nary a step behind, but Anna would not, could not look back. She would only look up, because upwards was the objective. Halfway up, another surge of breathless impatience filled her mind, urging her to move faster. At the top, she pressed her bare hand against the snowflake-marked door. After the unbearable thirty seconds that passed waiting for the door to dematerialize, Anna stepped through.

All was as it should be. She remembered this place well from the last time, and she doubted she would ever forget. Everything was the same. Chandelier situated high above, casting an unearthly azure light on the rune-carved stones of the chamber. Casket on the other end of the room, bearing the sleeping master of the castle. And beyond, the Mirror, now with nearly two-thirds of its broken form repaired.

Anna took another step forward.

And stilled, unable to move, as the Sorcerer advanced.

"I have seen this place before through the eyes of another, but to be here myself…" With a roving gaze, the Sorcerer took in everything before them. Forgoing the Mirror and even the reliquary situated above them, he stepped around Anna and strode over to the casket containing Markus. When he next spoke, he bent over to stare at the encapsulated king. "I wasn't sure whether I wanted to drag you down with me even more than I wanted to live. But now that I'm here, I suppose I may as well do both."

Anna could not speak. She barely registered the appearance of the hooded, shadowed man, as though a veil had been cast over her mind. She knew he was there, and that was the greatest extent of her reaction. In her mind, there was nothing out of the ordinary.

"I _am_ sorry to have done this to you, Anna. I doubt you can even understand me as you are now, and when you wake you will not heed my words. But I promise you," said the Sorcerer, moving out of his predatory crouch and straightening his back, "I would not have done this if there were any other way."

At his beckoning, Anna moved forward seven steps, so that the exact center of the room was between her and the Sorcerer and she stared directly into his eyeless mask. Above them, the chandelier began its descent and deconstruction, so that the sharp edges and blades disappeared. Only the reliquary remained hovering between them, flickering blue light that reflected off both their faces, both of them entranced as they stared at the hauntingly beautiful heart. The Sorcerer raised his hand, and across from him, Anna mirrored his movements.

"Please, Anna. Save me. Save _all_ of us."

The Sorcerer reached forward for the reliquary.

Anna felt herself beginning to move, beginning to reach forward just as he did.

Outstretched fingers inches away from the orbed snowflake, close enough to hear the low humming of the reliquary, close enough to feel a tug on her own heart where its shard had embedded itself, Anna woke. Something cut through the haze that clouded her mind. Anna stilled an instant before she touched the reliquary, and this time it was the Sorcerer who mirrored her movements and froze. She raised her head and stared directly at the Sorcerer.

"No, I'm sorry."

Anna retreated backwards while the Sorcerer stood silently and seemingly frozen, hand still raised and poised to take the reliquary. Only after she moved far enough to stand at the entrance did the Sorcerer slowly lower his hand to his side. Complete silence reigned between them, tense, uneasy silence. For long moments it went unbroken by the unbreathing Sorcerer, until at last his hand clenched into a fist and the cracking of his knuckles pierced through the hush like the crack of a whip.

"How did you manage to break free?" Whether or not Anna might have answered, the Sorcerer shook his head and exhaled a rattling hiss. "No, I understand why. I was played for a fool."

"And now you die here."

Elsa had arrived.

* * *

It was her first time actually seeing the Sorcerer, and Elsa expected it would be the last.

After everything she had done to lure him out of hiding, she refused to let him leave here alive. Elsa pulled Anna behind her and kept her eyes fixed on the Sorcerer, who stood with head bowed as though in penance, silent and unmoving. She could not immediately deduce who lay under that admittedly unsettling skull-like mask. At any rate, it made no difference. She would just have to rip the mask off his corpse, and his identity would be made known just the same. It was only a matter of time before then.

"I underestimated you," said the Sorcerer. "I didn't know you were capable of such cunning, such treachery. Well played, Queen Elsa. We are more alike than even I had ever imagined."

It was just as Oliver had described. Something about the Sorcerer's deep-pitched voice rankled, jarringly disorienting with its quiet intensity. Not a deadened tone like her own but wounded, desperate, cornered. In Oliver it had inspired some twisted sense of empathy. For Elsa, the uncomfortable edge of his horrible truth sent a red haze seeping through her vision, until her view tunneled on the one who had wreaked so much havoc and sown so much discord.

"Don't compare us. We are nothing alike."

"Of course not. You are Queen Elsa."

"And who are you?"

"Nobody." Lifting his head to stare as the chandelier ascended and the reliquary returned to its rightful place, the Sorcerer added, "But there is still this one thing in which we are the same. You should understand most of all the desolation in my heart, the void left in its wake."

Elsa narrowed her eyes. "I was not the one to experiment on hapless victims."

"You enjoy reading _Faust_ and I daresay you will recognize this line. Art is long, and life is short. Is it so wrong of me to want to live, to experience life as I was meant to before the chance was stolen from me?"

"And this somehow justifies everything you have done?"

"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us," said the Sorcerer, and Elsa recognized the quote from _Faustus_. An _exact_ quote, word for word, and Elsa could guess that the Sorcerer too could recite the story by heart. It seemed they shared a fascination with the tale. "Do not pretend to appreciate morality, Elsa. Both of us know life has no meaning when it must end, when the path to an end is riddled with pain. So, I shall abandon pretense and pursue life, pursue meaning."

"What pitiful meaning have you managed to scrape away from all this then?"

"…Do not presume to lecture me." Even though he spoke calmly, restrained anger bled through his words all the same. It was a dangerous calm, the calm of a man on the verge, one who realized his position and yet could do nothing to stop his fall. It was the calm of a man who _welcomed_ the fall, because to do otherwise would mean his ruin. "You of all people have no right to lecture me, you, with hands stained with the blood of thousands, you, without an inkling of purpose or meaning save for what others have deigned to relegate to you. I am a shell, but you are a puppet."

Elsa almost lunged forward, save for Anna keeping her grounded with a sudden grip around her arm. She tried for a moment to pull away, intent on attacking the Sorcerer, but Anna held on with all of her characteristic persistence until she caved. Finally, Elsa turned back. Anna wordlessly shook her head, and Elsa chafed at the gesture. Was Anna really so naive that she would give heed to his twisted ideology, spare the Sorcerer? Was she going to choose him over her–?

"Please, Elsa," Anna whispered.

No. All of her anger drained away when she heard Anna, her soft voice such a contrast to the Sorcerer's impassioned tones, and Elsa saw clearly. Anna was concerned for _her_, had stopped her for _her_ sake. She had come close to losing control, and Anna had only been trying to keep her grounded. Elsa nodded and looked forward once again, towards the Sorcerer.

"Get out of my head," Elsa said.

"I have done nothing to you. I cannot."

"Do you expect me to believe any of what you say?"

"Believe what you will," said the Sorcerer, shrugging, and Elsa noticed the buildup of shadow around him. Its grasping reach extended nearly a foot outwards in every direction, thin, viscous tendrils tasting the air at his feet. "You have neither heart nor desire for me to manipulate."

Well, he had certainly done a fine enough job even without the aid of his magic. Elsa had allowed him to gather his power while they spoke. But even still, she knew that his powers were no match for her own. Already she could feel the ice in her blood surging in response to challenge. All of this would end soon.

"If you are finished talking," Elsa said, "I believe you have stalled long enough."

"Already eager for blood, without sparing a thought for the woman behind you." Anna flinched and the Sorcerer continued, "Does she know what you have done to her in your quest to reach me? Well, Anna?"

"Stop. Don't try to do this again. All right? Just – I'm not stupid. I know when you're messing with my head," Anna said, practically trembling, releasing a shuddering breath before she spoke again. "And, yeah, I know what Elsa did. But that's something between us, not something for you to use against her."

"Hypocrisy at its finest–"

"That's enough!"

Elsa lashed out just as the Sorcerer raised his arm.

Ice slammed into a wall of shadows, but within a second the defense froze over, then shattered with an ear-splitting shriek. Elsa redirected her attack to give chase while the Sorcerer fled, solid form half-dissolved into shadow and weaving through the barrage. It reminded her of a snake. Motions erratic, gliding low to the ground and then spiking upwards towards the ceiling, twisting this way and that to avoid her bolts of ice, the Sorcerer appeared well in control; Elsa knew otherwise. Every time she struck, she came closer to hitting him. And there was only so much space to maneuver within the tower chamber. It was impossible for him to avoid her forever.

Likely he realized that too. With a sudden corkscrew the Sorcerer bounded back to the ground, dark wisps exploding outwards from where he landed. Elsa could recognize a shift in the air. Even the light in the chamber seemed to dim, drawn inwards towards the Sorcerer and swallowed by the darkness bleeding off his form. Just the buildup sent a pulse over her skin that set her hair on end. At last, the Sorcerer extended a hand and the inky substance spiraled along the length of his arm, launched at Elsa as a gargantuan wave that dwarfed her entirely.

She nearly scoffed.

Elsa stood her ground, reached out, and caught the blast with her bare hand. She withstood the impact without budging an inch, without even needing to brace herself, and the originally vast wave slowly collapsed into itself until it had shrunk to little more than a handful. Shadows pulsed and writhed within her grasp, but the cold she radiated spread throughout the black mass, frost creeping up the shadows until it froze over. Elsa crushed the jagged shard and the pieces crumbled to the ground.

On the shards of ice though…

"Go, Anna," Elsa said, seeing her reflection and vexed that Anna was _still_ just standing there, unaware of the danger. At her order, the redhead snapped out of whatever trance had held her and turned.

_"No one leaves!"_

As soon as the Sorcerer uttered his hateful scream, shadows erupted from the ground and blocked off the exit; Anna jerked away with a yelp, a whisper away from burning herself on the flame-like wall. Elsa could have destroyed it with ease. She _would_ have if not for the Sorcerer suddenly launching a frenzied barrage of blasts all throughout the small chamber, hurling shadow and flame without rhyme or reason. Elsa put up a barrier of her own to cover both herself and Anna, pulling Anna into her arms as flares struck her wall one after another. Anna held on tightly while the chamber floor quaked and the walls shuddered, and all Elsa could manage while protecting Anna was continue repairing the wall. It was infuriating; Elsa thrived on the attack. Doing nothing was maddening.

Elsa looked down, saw Anna terrified, and snapped.

A thin line of pressurized ice carved through her own barrier without resistance as Elsa whipped her hand around, and the long spear arced through the air to slice at the Sorcerer's mask. Instantly the barrage ceased. Unfortunately, Elsa never caught a glimpse of the face behind the mask. The Sorcerer ducked before she could slice through his mask completely, though not before the spear had gouged through the cheek. When he released a triumphant laugh, though, Elsa realized her mistake.

The Sorcerer had been standing right in front of the Mirror.

When he ducked, her ice struck the Mirror and was absorbed.

For a moment, nothing seemed to happen. Only the faintest ripple of light through the incomplete surface of the Mirror hinted that anything was amiss, but before long the faint ripple grew stronger, and stronger, until it became a blinding flare that pulsed quicker and quicker, and instinctively Elsa turned around to shield Anna with her body. Not enough. The Mirror released a shockwave of energy that flung them apart, and even Elsa was powerless to resist when she was thrown aside to the ground.

Black spots crept into her vision. Vague, disorderly thoughts overtook her own. It was the loud groan of the tower that snapped Elsa back to attention, and she saw that the Mirror had pulverized the entire midsection of the chamber, leaving the walls a bare-bone skeleton. It would collapse any second. Anna lay unconscious. Elsa could do nothing to stop the Sorcerer when he fled out the gaping holes of the tower. She focused all her energy into forcing ice to emerge from where the stone ended. With painstaking effort she reconnected the torn frame. She was nearing completion of the arduous task–

A shadowy hand reached through an opening and took Anna.

Elsa leapt through the hole just as Anna was pulled through, and she took the redhead within her arms before freefalling. Wind beat at her skin, blew past her with concussive force and whipped her hair about, but Elsa threw out her hand and summoned a pillar of ice that plunged down to earth; Elsa held on and slid down the column, but her concentration was still too jarred for much else. With an inelegant landing, Elsa and Anna collapsed into the snow, once again separated by the impact.

Elsa looked up, and saw the Sorcerer once again.

Without a single wasted movement, he launched himself forward. Elsa was still disoriented from the fall, still on her knees when the Sorcerer approached. She was defenseless, close enough to see even the chipped paint of the effigy burned onto his mask, and she reflexively jerked backwards but to no avail. The Sorcerer drew back a gauntleted fist, white steel flashing bright, and punched.

Ice rose between them. Only her automatic defense protected her from harm; Elsa hadn't been expecting the sudden physical blow. Even then, his velocity alone lent such strength to the Sorcerer's punch that a hairline crack emerged in the hastily erected wall. Minor damage, but still the most anyone had ever accomplished.

Spikes emerged from the wall, and the Sorcerer retreated.

But unlike her original thought, Elsa realized she had not _pressured_ him into retreat. It was a tactical maneuver. Now he stood steps away from Anna, placing the princess perfectly between them, and Elsa had little choice but to halt any attack for fear of the Sorcerer hurting Anna or, God forbid, hurting her herself. With an almost curious tilt of his head, the Sorcerer observed her. Elsa rose to her feet, careful not to do anything that might provoke him.

"Choose, here and now," said the Sorcerer, hand outstretched towards Anna's prone form lying across the snow. Wisps of black magic ghosted around his fingers. "You can either protect the girl or end me here, but you cannot do both."

"Don't tell me what I can and can't do. You think you threaten me?"

"Oh, no. I'm certain that your magic is much, much stronger than my own. In power, you have no equal. If Anna were not here to distract you, I could not have come this far. I would have died already." If Elsa were angry before, she practically saw red when the Sorcerer laughed. "Ironic that you used her to find me, but that she would also stop you from killing me."

"I can still kill you," Elsa said. "While protecting Anna."

"If you think yourself capable of the control, but as our battle has shown...I am the superior in that regard. Don't forget, I am your senior. While you were still with your happy, loving family, I was already being trained."

She ignored the jab. It was just meant to distract her. Elsa watched the Sorcerer carefully, but her eyes betrayed the indecision hidden behind her stone-cold mask. Against her will, her gaze flickered over to Anna. In a way, the Sorcerer was right. She could easily protect Anna, but that would give him precious time to escape. She could just attack the Sorcerer, but either he would kill Anna too, or she would do it herself in the backlash. Either route was easy. Doable. But both...

Could she risk Anna's safety?

After everything, she couldn't let the Sorcerer go. Not like this. Her pride could never tolerate the failure.

"Just try it," Elsa said. "I'll stop you."

"You do realize that you're inviting me to attack Anna. If this is a wager," said the Sorcerer, "I believe I have the upper hand. Try your luck, then."

It happened in an instant.

The Sorcerer launched his shadows at Anna, but the moment he moved Elsa reacted. With an upwards swing of her hand, the snow below the Sorcerer's arm burst forth, and though it took everything she had to dampen the output of her magic, she managed to weaken herself just enough. Snow wrapped around the Sorcerer's wrist, dragging him down. Uttering a cry of surprise, he stumbled. His attack missed and sputtered ineffectually against the ground. With her free hand, Elsa threw a bolt of lightning at the man.

Electricity seared through nothing but shadow, but even as the wispy form of the Sorcerer retreated through the skies, Elsa continued to track him. Just in case, she erected a barrier around Anna.

Elsa watched as the black mass soared directly overhead. With a stamp of her foot ice curved into a ramp and rippled under her feet, pushing her along in conjunction with the propulsion from a flurry jetting from her hand. She leapt forward off the end. Her first spear missed as the Sorcerer veered away, but though Elsa began to fall back to earth, another block of ice was rising under her to propel her upwards once again. A second spear, and then a third, but the fourth try–

A tendril of snow wrapped around the Sorcerer's arm.

Elsa closed her hand and the snow compressed.

With a sickening crack, the bone snapped and the Sorcerer fell from the sky, broken, defeated, screaming his fury to the heavens that had never heard his prayers.

* * *

Pain.

It was pain as he had never felt before. Not since carving out his heart at the whim of another, and that memory had been from a time so long ago, so hazy, so unreal, that it felt like something out of someone else's life. It could not have been him who was that naive child who believed in the goodness of man, the boy who trusted and laughed and lived and loved. No. It was a phantom pain he remembered. It lingered on the edge of his thoughts only, a distant reminder of the pain of another whose life had ended that day, and whose death gave birth to a monster swathed in shadow. It was what fueled him, drove him forward, like the crack of a whip against the back of an enslaved beast.

Not like the ice that broke him now and rendered him helpless at the mercy of others. It was cold. It burned. It was real, and beautiful, and he craved it now more than ever before. It was pain as he had never felt before, and for a man such as he, pain and pleasure were one and the same. Both reminded him that he was alive. His time had not yet ended. His light had not yet faded.

Vaguely, he registered that he was lying on his back. All feeling in his right arm was gone, and assuming that he still possessed the limb at all, he could not move it. With all the strength his tortured body could muster, he rolled over to his front. Another shock of pain, and he finally saw the crippled mess that remained of his right arm, mangled flesh burned black and bones no doubt shattered completely. It would not be functional in some time. With his left, he attempted to drag himself forward.

Sheer willpower allowed him to crawl forward a pace, maybe two, but before long the frost set in and for what should have been cold, it burned like fire and scalding oil. It was a good pain, but still debilitating. Pain overpowered any control of the body, ripped control away from the will. Desire to move did not translate to movement. So he gave up the fight, lay down, and relished the pain.

Seeing his blood mar the snow sent another jolt of thrill coursing through his veins, and he would have laughed if he were able. Beautifully red. Blood did more to vitalize him outside his body than within. Seeing some part of him – any part, any, any at all – escaping that empty husk of flesh and bone was cathartic. It was better than any drug, better than any other vice the world could offer. Here was undeniable proof of his existence. Dark red that dyed itself into the white and would forever leave a mark…

And then there was black.

And relief.

* * *

Elsa could see the Sorcerer collapsed not far away. Part of her debated killing him before doing anything else, and certainly she had no qualms about finishing him off; but Anna required her immediate attention, and loath as she was to simply leave him there, his injuries were too severe for him to escape. Just as precaution, Elsa constructed thick slabs of ice all around the Sorcerer, sealing him within airtight walls more than a foot thick. No chance of him slipping away, even with his incorporeal form. With the prison completed, she raced over to check on Anna.

Thankfully, Anna was unharmed. Elsa sat down and gingerly moved her head to her lap, cradling Anna within her hands. Dust and ash coated her skin and doubtless she would be bruised, but nothing long-lasting; Elsa had taken care to brace their fall with her own body, even cushioned by a layer of snow. Though Anna was still unconscious, doubtless she would wake soon enough.

"Anna," Elsa urged, shaking the redhead lightly. To her relief, Anna's eyes fluttered open, and though they were still half-shut, they were clear and unconfused. "How are you feeling?"

"Everything hurts," Anna groaned. She turned, pressing her cheek into Elsa's lap, and took a deep, shuddering breath. "L-Let me just try and sit up."

While Anna pushed down on the ground, Elsa braced her from behind. She could see the trembling in Anna's arms, but she was gratified that Anna still had this strength regardless. Before long Anna had shifted herself so she sat upright, and after more deep breaths and a few shakes of her head, she was as recovered as she would be.

"Did you…" Anna cleared her throat. "Did you get him?"

"I have him trapped in there; I can still sense him inside. Alive, but not for long," Elsa said, nodding her head towards the makeshift prison. "Stay here. I'll go and deal with him."

Elsa rose to her feet, but Anna clutched her wrist at the last moment. When she looked back, she saw Anna biting her lip in consternation. "Do you think that…?"

"I know what you want to ask, but I can't let him live." Elsa tried her hardest to contain her frown, but Anna was just too naive. "You have to understand why."

"Yeah," Anna murmured.

"It will be over soon, I promise. Stay behind the barrier."

Once Anna let go, Elsa strode over to where the Sorcerer was contained and put her hand against the wall, sensing what lay within its confines. No resistance from the Sorcerer at all, as she had expected. After having his arm crushed and frostbite spread throughout his body, not even he could escape. From what she had seen of his powers, Elsa doubted that he could manage that feat even at full strength, let alone injured, crippled and exhausted–

Vibrations pushed back on the other side of the ice, and Elsa jerked away.

What began as a quiet rumble grew into a roar, and a wave of black pierced through all four walls at the same time. All at once, an explosion of shadow tore apart the ice, sending the serrated pieces catapulting through the air like shrapnel. At point-blank range, Elsa caught the fragments launched her way but was still sent skidding backwards from the force, losing the precious second of counterattack.

She looked on in amazement as the mass of shadow jetted upwards and hurdled through the skies once again, without form at all and completely unrecognizable. It was so different. It was also the same. It was the same magic, had to be, but the presence was so substantially removed from what she became accustomed to. Before, when the Sorcerer melted into shadow, he still needed to keep at least part of himself corporeal. Now, Elsa could see only darkness, concentrated as it was not before, stronger and more focused. By the time she adapted to the greater mass, the heightened speed, it was too late.

Elsa flung the shrapnel in her hand at the shadow, but within a second it had dissolved away within the castle, to hide, to heal. She would not give the Sorcerer his chance.

"We pursue!"
