**Chapter 42: Let Slip the Dogs of War**

It was déjà vu to be here once again, with a fleet of ships at her command and bearing the flags of war.

Elsa could see Arendelle Castle as an infinitesimal blot on the horizon. Last time she invaded Arendelle, she had felt nothing at the sight of her old home. Part of her had expected to feel resentment, perhaps, some sting of remembrance. But there was nothing. All of her emotions had been so suppressed that she looked upon Arendelle and saw nothing but a piece of land, a temporary home for the Mirror shards that were her calling. She could never have guessed she would meet someone who would impact her life so much. She could never have guessed she would meet Anna.

"Word has spread of the injuries you sustained here," Markus said. "And now that you no longer appear to be invincible, many have rallied against you and mean to take a stand. Arendelle has allies now."

"Isn't that how the world works?" Elsa asked, tone flat, so deadened that she did not recognize it as the sound of her voice. "Show a hint of weakness, and the world will destroy you."

"Precisely." Markus smiled and slid on his helmet. "But they are fools to underestimate us. No matter what preparations they may have, nothing can overcome the both of us."

"We should take the outlying beaches and use them as our base," Elsa said. "From there, we can launch a ground assault. I do not believe it wise to repeat my tactics from last time."

Not for any tactical reason; Elsa didn't believe there existed any way to counter her powers entirely. But they didn't really need to take Arendelle. All she required was some distraction, and as soon as they had secured a vantage point, Elsa could travel to the trolls on her own. Once she had the Mirror she could leave again, before any harm might come to the castle, before any of its inhabitants might be…inclined to do something rash. Markus never cared about the kingdoms they conquered, so much as the shards they might possess, anyway.

"Excellent choice. We will do as you suggest." Markus motioned for the messengers to spread the word to the rest of the fleet. "But confide in me, my child. Does the sight of Arendelle still affect you so?"

"No. Arendelle doesn't affect me at all," Elsa said. "Though I may have some sympathy for the trolls. Part of me understands their desire for isolation."

"Pests, and nothing more. Always remember that you are better than them."

"Of course. If they refuse me, then I'll do what needs to be done."

She _did_ sympathize with the trolls, but she had come too far now to allow their obstinate stupidity to stop her from completing this great task. Elsa was numb to the death now. She had always been, until Anna tamed her and curbed her instinct. Being on the battlefield again, surrounded by war and death, brought all of her training rushing back. She could silence her conscience for the greater good.

But what _was_ the greater good?

"You still look troubled," Markus said.

"Not troubled, only…curious." Elsa strode to the cabin, unlocking the door that held the shards of the Mirror collected over the course of their conquest. "When you told me of the shards, you mentioned that some were found in the hearts of men. How will you extract those?"

"Only dust on the wind," Markus said, waving his hand. "None of that is of any consequence. What matters, for now, are the larger fragments." Searching her face, he added, "Why does that concern you?"

"It doesn't," Elsa answered, truthfully. "At least, not _their_ fates. I need the Mirror completed to repair my heart, and that is my only concern."

"Very good." Markus laid a hand over her shoulder, and together they looked into the shattered surface that reflected their broken image. "Soon, Elsa. We will both be saved, and Edmund too. All will be right."

Yes, Elsa thought.

Soon she would be free.

* * *

"Elsa is coming here?"

Anna couldn't stop asking Agdar questions, though she had just as many answers as she did questions. She was only vocalizing so the tumult of thought didn't drive her mad. All the questions she had, none of them seemed to matter at the thought that Elsa would be here, soon.

"Elsa, and King Markus," Agdar said.

"She woke him, then," Anna muttered, not altogether surprised that Elsa had turned to her surrogate father for guidance. She couldn't begin to imagine what that man had done to her head by now.

"Recently, the Southern Isles has attacked all of its neighboring kingdoms, and brought them under its rule," Agdar continued, and Anna mentally translated that as hunting for Mirror shards.

So that was why Elsa was back.

"I need you to stay in the castle and keep yourself safe," Agdar said. Cutting her off before she could protest, he added, "For now, Anna, I need you to promise me that you won't do anything foolish."

"What do you even think I'll do?" Anna asked.

"I know you want to see Elsa, and I know I told you that I'd support you in whatever you decided." Agdar took her hands in his own, voice pleading. "But right now, you need to stay here. Arendelle and its allies will do everything we can to counter the invasion. I cannot allow our people to be enslaved again."

"I understand." Anna looked her Pappa in the eye. "I'm not a kid anymore. I know when the time isn't right, and I promise that I won't do anything stupid."

She was never going to support Elsa. Not for something like this, when the lives of so many people hung in the balance. Anna knew that people would die for this crusade that Elsa had set her mind on, and even if Elsa winning the war would let them see each other soon, she would be insane to _want_ that. No. What she needed was to wait, and find the right time to make things happen.

Pappa knew that, and Anna knew that he knew she could never sit around and do nothing.

"I'm proud," Agdar said, tightening his grip once before letting go. "I truly do hope that you can find happiness. Anything you choose to do, Anna, just remember that your father is with you."

"Good luck, Pappa."

"Good luck, Anna."

Agdar spun around and headed to the warfront. Anna watched as he went, and she wondered, vaguely, if she would ever have another chance to tell him she loved him. She decided better of the idea, and Agdar finally vanished down the stairs. It would have sounded too much like a farewell.

Anna would rather think that Pappa knew, anyway.

Just like she did.

* * *

Her arrival was heralded by thundersnow.

All the skies whitened. Not the natural white-grey of stormclouds but a pure white sky, unbroken by the faintest wisp of clouds or fog. From the white void was unleashed a storm of ice and lightning, every bit of hail plummeting to earth with concussive force, every flash of lightning bringing with it a heavy crack of thunder. Amidst the chaos, the single ship of ice sailed towards Arendelle once again.

Despite the storm, the waters were calm. Elsa halted her ship at the mouth of the fjord, where two cliffs rose on either side of the inlet. Straight ahead the waterway led into the kingdom, and her fleet of ironclad battleships settled behind. Just in front, the combined fleet of Arendelle and its allies awaited, and beyond that, Arendelle Castle loomed over the steep hill. Trebuchets were lined up on the castle walls, cannons interspersed between their ranks.

It was a familiar sight, and Elsa didn't expect things to be any different this time around.

She could imagine King Agdar shouting off commands in the distance. Well, her ships needed protecting. Elsa raised her hands to the sky, feeling the pressure of her magic build in the sea. A ring of ice arced around her fleet and, with only a thought, burst upwards to form a glacial wall. Elsa watched the trebuchets being loaded and shook her head. She watched as the projectiles flew towards the wall, striking its surface one after another just like last time. They would do nothing–

Elsa clenched her hand tight, hissing through her teeth when she felt the burn on her ice. It was salt, barrels and barrels of the stuff slamming into the wall and slowly melting it away.

_Not enough._

She sent another wave of magic through the wall, letting one layer shear off into the water so that she could repair the rest. Every time the barrels came close now, Elsa fired off a shard of ice from the wall to intercept, catching each one in midair so that the shattered casks fell into the fjord. If Agdar really thought she could be so easily defeated by salt again…

Rounds of cannon fire came next, and these she could not catch. Not because they were moving too fast or because she couldn't track them – Elsa whipped her hand forward only to discover she had practically torn down her own wall launching those strikes. She didn't have enough ice left to defend. Heavy metal shells punched through the now-fragile ice, sending the fragments flying like shattered glass. Yelling came from the other ships at the impossible sight. For the first time in history, Elsa's defense had been broken.

Arrows flew toward the now vulnerable fleet, and Elsa didn't need to look to know that her men, unused to being unprotected, were now fleeing back into the cabins. Useless. She didn't bother moving as a volley came straight for her head. Ice sprung up from the body of her ship and the arrows bounced off, clattering onto the icy surface and sliding into the sea. Defense had never been to her liking, anyway. Elsa drew deep in her magic, gathering the lightning roiling beneath her skin.

Rattling disrupted her concentration. Grating cranks rang in the inlet and Elsa looked up to see soldiers rolling up a ballista on one of the fjord cliffs. It fired directly across, shooting a pronged bolt that stabbed into the opposite cliff. Its purpose became clear soon. What had appeared to be a bolt soon unfurled into a steel net that plummeted into the fjord. Farther away, steel nets fell from the castle towers. A cannon shot off into the sky, and every ship of the Arendellian fleet unloaded something like anchors but not quite – great mounds of scrap metal cobbled together into a shapeless mass.

Elsa forced back her magic, almost shaking with indignation. If she attacked now, with steel hitting the fjord, any electrical attack would conduct. It would be drawn through the net and into the water – and then destroy her own fleet, the fleet that was very much iron. Part of her _wanted_ to just fire off the lightning. She could protect herself from the backlash.

"Cease," Markus said, and Elsa turned to see the king emerging from his cabin. "Shape your ice into a blade, and I'll do the rest."

Elsa did as told, moving her hand in an arc so that ice formed a crescent blade. Markus outstretched one hand and shadows erupted on the edge, thick, black flames that appeared as though her ice had been doused in oil. Together, they pushed forward.

Ice and shadow struck the net. Ice froze the steel and turned it brittle. Shadow provided the concussive force to break through. When its bolts were ripped out of the cliff, the entire net, alight in the black flames, was tossed towards the Arendellian fleet. One ship caught fire, incendiary sparks flying from its wooden hull to spread across the line of ships. While they scrambled to put out the flames, Elsa beckoned for the sky to intensify its storm. Snow fell in violent typhoons that whipped the sail-powered ships about, as the now-turbulent sea slammed into their side. It was just too bad, Elsa thought, that they chose to use those antiquated relics just to avoid her lightning.

"Come inside," Markus said, gesturing to the cabin. "Let the fleet do its work. We shall rest, and when the time comes, you will do your part."

Elsa inclined her head into a slight nod. She was loath to leave the battle, but Markus had a point. Gesturing for the rest of the fleet to advance, and seeing the Arendellian navy respond in kind, Elsa prepared to enter the cabin. Before that, though, she turned back to look at the castle one more time.

Soon, Elsa thought.

_I'm doing this for you, Anna._

* * *

News came in that Elsa had taken the beaches.

Everything was calm now, and they would be, for the next few hours.

Anna looked out the window to witness the winter storm. All of its violence had faded now, withdrawn for the momentary respite. What had once been typhoons and hail was now replaced by calm snow, drifting down to blanket the kingdom with a cover of white. It was still a beautiful sight. Even knowing the destruction that all this beauty could twist into, Anna would always find the snow beautiful.

She opened the window and stretched out her hand, feeling the snowflakes brush past her skin and fall through her fingers. Not the sharp, jagged edges of hail that could cut through skin, but powdery snow, like the snow they had used to build Olaf. One snowflake drifted down and rested in her palm for a brief second before the wind carried it away. Anna withdrew her hand. Even from here, she could see the encampment lying on the frozen beaches.

If she was going to do anything, now was the time.

But before she went, Anna knelt down next to Olaf's inanimate form.

"Thank you, Olaf," Anna said. "I think I finally get what you were trying to tell me. I'm going to try my best to make things right, and I promise, I won't be selfish this time."

She was ready this time. Not to make Elsa understand, or to change her mind about anything, even. Anna just wanted to apologize. She wanted to start over, and let Elsa make her own choices.

Olaf didn't respond, but Anna had faith that he would wake up, one day. Observing the snowman, she noticed, not for the first time, that he felt oddly incomplete. Oh, he had sticks for arms and coal for buttons, and even some twigs for hair, but he was still just _almost_ perfect. Anna had the thought for a good while. She unzipped her satchel and withdrew a carrot. It was probably for the best that he was asleep, Anna thought, wincing as she jabbed the carrot through the snowman's face.

At last, she arranged the carrot to satisfaction. Anna took a step back and smiled, imagining how pleased Olaf would have been at his new nose.

"Now you're perfect!"

No response, of course. Anna took one last look at the snowman before walking to the door, ready to see Elsa again. Halfway through twisting the doorknob, she paused to take a deep breath. She wasn't nervous, strangely. She just needed to do this. It was something that had always needed to be done.

It just had to be this way, Anna thought.

She departed.

If Anna had stopped to look around, she would have seen the snowman start moving.

* * *

Anna didn't even need to sneak out of the castle.

It was easier getting around than she would have thought. Despite the commotion from the war and the surge of people running about the castle grounds, everybody seemed much too preoccupied to notice her leaving. Wearing a heavy cloak and with her hood drawn up, Anna looked like any common workhand, and Agdar had permitted much of the staff to leave the castle and find their loved ones. She was unimpeded while walking out the front gates.

It was colder than she expected; Anna still wasn't used to being without the protection of the reliquary, and this cold was different from the one in the Southern Isles. A malevolent wind swept through the land, somehow deliberate in its violence. It chilled to the bone. Every step was torturous agony. Anna felt her mouth and eyes dry within seconds, the exposed skin of her face stinging with invisible cuts.

She moved on.

Past the gates and through the marketplace, off the main road and to the side was the small strip of land circling around to the outer banks. Anna dropped down the cobblestone path and onto the white beach, where the snow was thick enough to reach halfway up her boots. It wasn't too bad. It would just be a few minutes more, Anna thought, trudging through the thick slush. She had to stop every now and then to knock on her boots and crack the creeping ice, but that was fine. Just a few minutes more.

And then she would see Elsa.

Once she passed the shadow of cliffs and trees, Anna could see the encampment. Smoke rose from the site in great big plumes. It lay maybe thirty meters away on the outlying beach, near the mouth of the fjord. Only one thing stood in her path, and though that path was a straight one…

It was also frozen solid.

It should have been sand, but the turmoil of the storm must have flooded the banks, and then the cold froze the water into irregular waves. Anna tentatively stepped foot on the ice and immediately drew back. It was thin. Not like the thick sheets of ice that had surrounded the Southern Isles, but merely a byproduct of this cold storm. It wasn't magic, but regardless, not enough time had passed for the ice to strengthen. It could break at any moment and she would be sent plummeting through, to the freezing waters lurking just beneath.

"I hope I don't regret this," Anna muttered, and she began her journey.

Anna kept her eyes trained to the ground and gauged every step of the way, testing her weight before going any farther. Nearly a quarter of the way through, Anna placed her foot forward and drew away, breathing deeply at the feeling of the ice shifting under her feet, practically molding to the contour of her heel. Another fraction of a second and the ice would have broken. Anna tried the left, and then the right, to no avail. Only one way left to go.

Back.

Anna retraced her steps to the beginning and started over again. Even after that, more than once she had to divert her path. What should have been a straight path became a winding road, full of zigzags and detours. It seemed to take hours and hours to get anywhere at all, but eventually the end was in sight, the encampment only ten meters away. She took a step onward, just a bit too heavily.

Immediately the ice cracked.

Anna froze at the dull creaking, feeling her breath hitch painfully as cold air settled in her lungs. Nearly breathless, she edged to the side. Even the tiniest movement seemed to rock the ice plain, so that the groaning of the ice became protracted, stretched out like an anguished death throe. When the crack widened another centimeter, she ground to a halt. She could practically see water thrashing under the surface of the ice. Stay relaxed, Anna told herself, and she inched forward again.

Any peace fled out the window when the next crack sounded off like a cannon and the ice tore apart.

Anna had barely heard the noise, barely registered the sloshing of water as ice fell into the depths, before she broke into a dead sprint across the fjord. She didn't dare to look back. She couldn't stop to hesitate. She couldn't stop to think out her next step. She couldn't stop for anything.

She was so _close_ now…!

Anna slipped on the ice when another fissure jarred the surface. She fell on her front, steps away from the beach, and she squeezed her eyes shut, waiting to be submerged into cold.

Someone pulled on her wrist.

One tug and Anna felt herself roll into the snow, bones jarred with every tumble. But she was alive. Someone had saved her. Anna opened her eyes blearily, squinting at the harsh light glaring up above, before the sky was blocked by a mop of blond hair. Her rescuer peered down with a familiar frown.

"You are insane _and_ stupid," Kristoff said, shaking her shoulders. "Who in their right mind decides to just walk over thin ice? It's even an expression for doing something stupid!"

There were a million things she could have said. It felt like an eternity since she had last seen anyone from the Southern Isles, though they had slowly become a fixture in her life. Part of her wanted to ask Kristoff how he had been, and the other part wanted to thank him for saving her life, but she could only blurt out one thing.

"Wh-What are you doing here?" Anna asked.

"Making sure you don't get yourself killed."

"No, I mean…" Anna swallowed and propped herself up. "Why are you here in Arendelle?"

Kristoff didn't even need to answer verbally. Such guilt overcame his features that his sullen scowl faded away, and Anna could see the armor he wore, just a little more ornate than the other soldiers.

"Elsa put me in charge," Kristoff said.

"It's not your fault," Anna murmured. "Are any of the others here?"

"Practically everyone has gone off to war somewhere," Kristoff said. "Alek and Hans were sent somewhere else, I think, but they're probably on their way. Why are _you_ here?"

"I'm here to see Elsa."

"Whatever you think you're going to do," Kristoff said, "I promise you that it won't work. She's not going to stop just because you tell her to. She's nothing like you remember anymore."

"I'm not here for that." Anna smiled. She brushed off the snow on her cloak and pushed herself to her feet, ignoring the uncertain half-gesture that Kristoff made to help her up. "But she'll always be Elsa."

Anna began walking toward the camp. An array of tents had been set up already, and the beginnings of sturdier barracks constructed. Soldiers bustled about, starting campfires, aiding in construction. Anna had reached the camp already before Kristoff caught up, seemingly too stunned to argue. Instead he waved off the soldiers who gave her incredulous looks, but eventually, he grabbed her arm.

"What are you here for, then?"

"I just want to talk to Elsa."

Anna scanned the tents, easily identifying the one that belonged to Elsa. It was a pavilion at the back of the clearing, far from everyone else and larger than the rest. Most telling was the snowflake crest adorning the white cloth, the only thing making it stand out from the snow.

She was finally here.

She thought she would be more nervous.

"It's not safe for you here," Kristoff said. When Anna pulled out of his grasp and kept walking, he finally just walked ahead and blocked the way. "Please, Anna. Elsa won't listen to you. She won't even agree to _see_ you. She ordered that no one is to disturb her, and specifically – not you."

"Then I'll wait here until she agrees to see me."

Anna felt nothing but calm. More importantly, she felt a sense of rightness that had been absent before. She was meant to be here, and this was what she was supposed to be doing. Anna wanted nothing more than to burst into the tent and take Elsa by the hand, hold her close and never let go, kiss her lips and never stop; but she needed to earn that again. Stupid Elsa probably thought _she_ was the one at fault; Anna almost laughed at the irony. She was, of course, but really, _both_ of them were at fault. Someone just needed to take the first step.

Anna stopped at the pavilion, and dropped to her knees in the snow.

* * *

"She's here," Elsa murmured.

Elsa didn't know what else she had been expecting. Of course Anna would come. It was just like Anna to be stubborn enough to hold onto someone as broken as she was, ignoring the wounds she suffered from the jagged edges. Elsa smiled despite herself. It was selfish, but she felt so warm just knowing that Anna was on the other side of the pavilion, knowing that, even after everything, Anna wouldn't give up.

She wanted so much to just step outside.

She wanted, more than anything, just to see Anna.

But Elsa knew she couldn't do that. It would be too selfish. Anna would forgive her for everything, Elsa knew that, but Anna deserved so much more than this shadow that she was now. She couldn't bear to let Anna see her now, still every bit as imperfect as the day they parted, still so inadequate in comparison to Anna. She could be better than this, for Anna, but not this day. She needed more time.

Elsa still needed the Mirror to give back her heart.

Only then would she be worthy of love.

"I'm so sorry, Anna."

* * *

It was the worst pain she had ever felt, but Anna didn't mind.

From the moment she began kneeling snow had begun to fall, gently at first, but with every passing moment the storm intensified. Now it raged more violently than it ever had. Every gust of wind felt like knives dragging over her broken skin. Every pellet of hail felt like boulders crashing into her bruised body. Anna didn't even know how much time had passed. Kristoff had reluctantly left at some point, drawn away by military affairs. It had been hours since then, every second feeling like its own eternity.

It barely felt cold anymore. She was just numb. She had stopped shivering after a while, too stiff even for that, but all her joints ached like the bones were grating against one another. She could barely see, but she didn't know whether to blame vortex of snow whipped about in the wind, or her blurring vision.

But Anna had decided she would stay here until she saw Elsa.

Out of the blurred dizziness, she registered that someone was staring. Anna slowly raised her head to look. Kristoff stood not far away. Separated by the never-ending snow, Anna couldn't clearly see his expression; but she thought he looked grieved as they stared at one another in silence. Step by step, Kristoff walked over to her side.

"Anna, this is insane," Kristoff said.

"I promised myself…I would do this," Anna said. She licked her cracked lips and tasted blood. It stung even to move the muscles of her jaw to talk. "I'm not helpless. I'm not going to just let her push me away again."

"You need to warm yourself up!"

But Anna resisted every time he tried to drag her away. She pulled free from his grasp with strength that surprised even her, strength that she thought she no longer possessed. When Kristoff tried instead to talk her into leaving, Anna didn't respond. She would not budge from her spot. She would not look away again, not even for an instant. She kept her eyes firmly ahead, staring into the white pavilion.

"…Please, Anna," Kristoff whispered. "Please just go home."

"Go," Anna murmured. "I understand, Kristoff. I'm still going to do this."

"I really don't get you sometimes!" Kristoff snarled, moving to stand between her and the tent, grasping her shoulders tightly enough that her sore joints ached in protest. "Why are you doing this to yourself?"

"…Because sometimes, love just has to be this way."

Not easy, and not beautiful, but painful and torturous. She couldn't keep taking the easy way out anymore. If this storm was her penance then Anna would gladly bear through its wrath, but there was no need for Kristoff to suffer the cold too; Anna wanted him to go back inside. She could do this alone.

Kristoff dropped to his knees and waited at her side.

"Then tell _her_ that," Kristoff said.

Anna looked towards the pavilion and spoke.

"Last time, I didn't understand you enough, Elsa. And I still don't understand you, not as much as I want, but I know why you pushed me away. It's taken me a really long time to get it. At first, I blamed you so much for giving me that impossible choice, because there wasn't really a choice at all. And that was true. You were only trying to see how much I really knew you, how much I really accepted you, and I failed... But it was still unfair of you. And you don't understand _me_ enough, if you really think a storm is going to stop me. I'm going to stay here until you come out, Elsa. I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to apologize. And for once, you are going to listen to me.

"I am so, so sorry that I tried to change you. I even told you so many times that I loved you as you are, that I would love you no matter what, but I never realized what I was really doing. But you knew. I know you did, because you wouldn't have tried so hard to change otherwise. You were trying so hard to change yourself to make me happy, and I'm sorry that I made you do that. I didn't know, but that's not an excuse. I manipulated you as much as anyone did. I made you dependent on me.

"Part of me was in love with the idea of fixing you, like my love could make everything all right and make you happy again. Like I was somehow enough to make up for everything you've gone through, so you could be the way you were before. But that's just not possible. I can't wipe out all those things that you are now, just like you couldn't forget your past no matter how hard you tried. Because even after everything, you've never changed. You are still that same girl in the memories I saw, and you always will be. It's just that…you're also more now. Everything that you've gone through is a part of you, and I always wanted you to accept that. Even when I hadn't yet, not really.

"I've made you a lot of promises before, but this time, I really mean everything I say. I love you the way you are, Elsa. I will always love you. You don't have to change for me. You don't need to be fixed. You've never been perfect, but I'm not either and I'm all right with that, because you wouldn't be you otherwise. You have never been heartless, and I don't mean me, because I could never be a substitute for your heart. Your heart has always been with you. You've tried to forget that you had one, but the truth is, you have never been any less whole than me or anyone else. Please don't let anyone make you think otherwise. Even if that person turns out to be me."

Anna bowed her head. Time passed slowly and the intensity of the storm never lessened, the fierce wind and snow thrashing the heavens, the earth, everything in its way with all its might. Her only warmth was the tears running down her face, mixing with the melted snow that drenched her body. Kristoff placed his hand on her shoulder, joining her in solidarity, and Anna smiled. She had said what she needed to say. Though the cold might have penetrated her body, she was warm in her heart. It was enough.

And then the tent opened.

For just a brief moment, Anna was ecstatic. She thought she had succeeded at last, that she had gotten through to Elsa. When the tent opened, she thought she would see Elsa.

It was not Elsa.

It was Markus.

"Worthless protestations of love will not change anything."

Anna saw the coming darkness, and then she knew no more.
