**Chapter 41: Cry Havoc**

War was coming.

All the navy had been assembled, and all the soldiers readied, all the slaves marshalled, all the able-bodied civilians drafted. Elsa had never thought she would see this day, when all the princes were armored and she would stand amongst them rather than above, but Markus took that spot now. She handed over the reins of power gladly. She was only a soldier now, as she was always meant to be.

"My children," Markus said. "We have at last won a great victory. Not one fought on the field of battle, but rather one fought within our hearts – the _true_ battleground. For too long have the hearts of our people grown weak, decadent. But no more, and never again, not while I yet draw breath, not while you all stand here united. Today, we take a stand and banish weakness from our souls."

Outfitted in armor, Markus struck an imposing figure. Through the Y-shaped opening, his helm revealed glowing blue eyes gleaming with anticipation. Even now, standing before his children and giving an impassioned speech, Elsa could see the desire for battle in his eyes, an insatiable lust for carnage. But there was something more there. Urgency, not just for himself, but for Edmund too.

It was time to claim the final pieces of the Mirror.

"Some of you may be hesitant. Some of you may harbor mercy. Do not falter. Do not carry any compunction that should sway your conviction. Is not this the calling of nature? It is only the natural order that we, the strong, should supplant the weak, that our glory be built upon the fires of rebirth. It has always been like this, that the world might evolve. It would be disservice, cowardice, to halt the growth of our kingdom, of our people. Power is meant to be seized! What difference separates mankind from the beasts, the insects, if we do not impose order upon the chaos?

"We must be the ones to do this. We are the conquerors. We are the saviors. Soon, the war will begin, but I can tell you now that we are the ones with the fortitude to bear the burden of glory, the boldness to claim what is rightfully ours, the strength to stand up and fight for the greater good.

"Now the dark begins to rise, and the curtain falls as the world slumbers away. In the darkness of peace, the world has regressed, until now…we know not even the faintest bloom of desire. Peace can only bring stagnation. We will define ourselves with conflict! In the face of such an insidious thing as peace – I will not think, or speak, or act with moderation. I will not yield – I will not equivocate – I will not excuse – I will not give ground, nor retreat a single inch! We march now to victory!"

Markus strode out of the throne room, the white-and-red plume of his helmet swinging behind him, twin swords buckled to his side. Elsa followed, ready to embark on one last voyage.

At its end, she would be with Anna.

* * *

Amazement at the trolls would be an understatement.

Anna had grown up hearing fairytales about these creatures. Seeing them in the flesh – in the rock – was about as close to being in a dream as anyone would ever come. It was told to children that the good trolls came and took away baby teeth placed under the pillow, replacing them with trinkets. If they behaved well, then the good trolls would bring presents during Yuletide and good luck for the new year ahead. Of course, the _bad_ trolls would take the bad children away and eat their toes.

"You guys don't happen to eat toes, right?"

"No," Pabbie said, laughing, but then he paused. "Hmm, I'm rather unsure what we _do_ eat. I don't think we eat at all. How strange…"

Having apologized a dozen times for being rude, and explaining that they'd simply caught her off guard, and _of course_ she was glad to meet them all , Anna felt that she was at least partially accustomed to the trolls. Most of them seemed as curious about her as she was curious of them. It was reassuring.

Chuckling, Pabbie introduced several others. Anna knelt down and stared intently at each troll, trying to memorize their distinctive traits. Pabbie was the one with a cape and a headdress, and Bulda had a necklace of pink crystals. Another had strange prismatic protrusions on his back, while one bore bright red crystals. Everyone had the same wide smile, the same short, stocky build, but they were different enough that Anna couldn't stop looking back and forth, trying to take in every single strange detail.

"All of this is just so magical," Anna said, laughing.

"It's our pleasure!" Bulda said, holding onto Anna's hands and examining her with a rather keen eye. It had taken some smooth talking to get Bulda to stop looking at her teeth. Anna couldn't decide if she was flattered. "We don't get visitors often, and none are as polite as you!"

"Bulda, let Anna breathe, please," Pabbie said, thankfully nudging her away before she could compliment her eyes again. "We have important things to talk about."

At the mention of her name, Anna turned back to Pabbie. Come to think of it, he had greeted her before by name, too. "How do you know my name, exactly?"

"We saw when you went with the Mirror-Child to her home," Pabbie said. Though Anna didn't understand the moniker, she could guess who he meant. She couldn't help but notice some of the others frittering at the mention of Elsa. "We've been watching over that place for a very long time."

Well, that explained how the place had been preserved.

"Wait, why would you do that?"

"It's something of a memorial," Pabbie said. "Who was it that led you here?"

"So that Elsa was real, then?" Anna shook her head. "But that's impossible. Elsa is in the Southern Isles, and she's not eight anymore, trust me. Wait! Did you conjure her up to lead me here?"

"No, I did not. Memories are very real things," Pabbie said, the graveness of his voice making Anna unconsciously calm down. "In certain places of great tragedy, there often remain…imprints, lasting echoes of the pain. Not everyone can see them, but you are very important, Anna."

"I-I don't understand. I'm sorry. It's just a lot to take in."

Seeing the version of Elsa that still smiled and laughed, Anna had almost forgotten what exactly had happened there in that ruined home. Knowing just why that memory of Elsa lingered was as harsh an awakening as being doused by winter rain. And now it turned out trolls were real, and they watched over the place? Why did they even bother? What did they care about Elsa?

"I understand," Pabbie said, helping Anna sit down. She collapsed fully onto the ground, clutching her legs close to her chest. "But perhaps I can help you with your confusion."

"Okay," Anna breathed. "So why do you care about Elsa?"

"We were born of the Mirror. You have seen it before?" Pabbie continued after Anna's confirming nod. "And we call Elsa the Mirror-Child, because it rightfully belongs to her, and can only be controlled by her heart. Anything concerning her concerns us too."

"But why didn't you just come down and meet her when we were building snowmen?"

"We had met Elsa already," Pabbie said. Before Anna could ask when, he continued, "Just days before we witnessed you two at her old home. She was here for the Mirror shard that we oversee."

It took Anna a moment to register that completely. First hearing it, she'd expected this meeting to be a long time ago, maybe while she was a child. Not while Elsa was here with her because of her request, less than a week before. Anna bit her lip. Had she been wrong about Elsa agreeing to come to Arendelle because of her? Did Elsa only come because she needed to find the shard? It'd never been about her, then. She could almost laugh at how stupid she was, thinking that there could be any other reason.

"Of course," Anna said.

"If I may, I think the situation was not _quite_ as you think." Pabbie smiled, shrugging in a way that Anna supposed was meant to be comforting. "She wasn't here just for the Mirror, but for you, too."

"We call people like her _wraiths_, because they no longer have a heart," Bulda said.

"Because she made a reliquary," Anna said.

It was hard to imagine that Elsa would be considered a wraith, like she was some monstrous ghoul. When she heard the word, Anna thought of some cloaked beast that sucked out people's souls, not the elegant beautiful image that was Elsa. Really, the Sorcerer seemed to fit _wraith_ a whole lot more.

But at the same time, Anna could understand why the trolls said that of Elsa.

She hated to admit that the memory of Elsa, face twisted with inhuman hate and painted in blood, still haunted her thoughts. She hated that, for a brief, brief moment…

Anna couldn't tell if she had been afraid.

"It's not easy to accept that the people we love are not perfect," Pabbie said. "And perhaps harder still for us to accept we ourselves are not perfect."

Bulda nodded. "It's not an easy decision, but she wanted to be whole again, for you. She came here asking for a way to reverse it. Not really healthy, but sort of admirable too."

"You mean…Elsa wanted to know how to get her heart back? Just for me…?"

It was easy to become bitter, easy to just fill the space Elsa had left with resentment, but Anna knew, deep down, that Elsa cared. Elsa had hated that part of herself, called her heart her weakness and hated the mere memory enough to carve out her heart and throw it away. But for her, she had been willing to accept it again.

"Does that ease your doubts, Anna?"

"It just…gives me more questions, honestly."

"Questions are good. It shows that you're willing to listen," Pabbie said, and Anna smiled. "It was much the same with another boy who had been here. You might know him: Gustaf of the Southern Isles."

Anna's smile fell, the compliment having turned into something much more like an insult. Gustaf was the last person she wanted to be like. "Yeah, I knew him. Gustaf was insane."

Pabbie frowned. "I do not know what the years did to him, but the Gustaf I met was anything but. Can you tell me more?"

"Well, he tried to overthrow his father, and–"

"Failed," Pabbie said, and Anna's eyes widened when he continued, "Yes, I encouraged him to stop his father's madness before greater harm could be done."

"I'm sorry," Anna said, feeling indignation rise like acid in her throat, "I think I heard you wrong. Are you telling me that you told him to start a rebellion against his own father?"

"Not all fathers are like your own, Anna. Some men are meant to be stopped, and Gustaf recognized that, and came to me for advice," Pabbie said gently.

"What could possibly make that okay?"

Pabbie considered her for a moment. Slowly, deliberately, sounding out each word so they were clear beyond any doubt, he said, "While Gustaf came here, Markus was below the cliff."

"Below the…cliff–!" Anna cut herself off. Or rather, the heady realization made it difficult to breathe, let alone speak. Now her thoughts raced faster than her mind could follow, trying to piece together the disjointed timeline, the dizzying, chaotic whirl of epiphany made her sick with horror.

Below the cliff, Pabbie had said.

Below the cliff was where Elsa used to live.

Gustaf had begun his rebellion twenty years ago, when Elsa was barely more than a year old. According to Elsa's memories, Markus had found her when she was _eight_, so those seven years in between–?

"What was Markus doing there?" Anna asked hoarsely.

"I think you already know the answer to your question," Pabbie said, closing his eyes.

"I _knew_ he couldn't have just shown up that conveniently," Anna said, leaping to her feet and unable to keep from shouting. "It was all planned, Markus was watching her all along! Who even knows what he could have done? What is he even planning now? I need to tell her, I need to go–!"

"No!" Pabbie seized her hand, and only then did Anna look back to see the frustration in his eyes, the disappointment. "How much more have you learned about Elsa, that you think you know enough to change her mind, when, without the aid of her heart resting in yours, you could see absolutely nothing of the person behind the mask?"

Anna stopped struggling. Pabbie released her and she stumbled back, hand falling limply at her side, her legs weak. It was true. It all came down to how little she really knew. She hadn't been able to understand what Elsa was thinking without the reliquary. All she could see was what was in front of her, either Elsa or the Queen, always one or the other but never both.

"I do not mean to discourage you," Pabbie said, more gently. "But not yet, Anna."

"I just want to help," Anna whispered.

"Some answers are meant to be found on one's own. Some decisions must be made by oneself," Pabbie said. "Otherwise, they have no value."

"I-I understand, I think."

"No, but you are beginning to, and that's what is important."

"What should I do now?" Anna asked. "I still don't know anything, I don't know what went wrong, I'm screwing everything up apparently. I don't know…I don't know how to fix…"

She shut her mouth before she could say the next word.

She knew what she was about to say, and she couldn't bear to admit it.

She didn't know how to fix – Elsa.

"Therein lays your problem," Pabbie said. "But I think you'll figure it out soon, Anna. It's always better to understand things for yourself than to be told."

"Wait!" Anna stretched out her hand, but Pabbie had already curled up into an inanimate boulder, falling into a deep sleep. One by one, the other trolls followed, each giving her a sympathetic glance before rolling away. Anna turned helplessly, wishing anyone would just _stay_ for a moment longer.

"Dear, I'm so sorry," Bulda said. She moved closer with clumsy, waddling steps, and Anna had never been more relieved. "Just remember that you can't change anyone because…people don't really change."

"What? So I'm never going to be able to fix anything?"

"That's not what I meant. It's only that people make bad choices, dear, and…I may have been too harsh on the girl when she was here." Bulda smiled and patted her face. "Don't be so negative. It's not like you at all. Come visit again sometime, once you've figured everything out?"

Bulda left her too.

And then she was alone.

* * *

Standing at the bow of her ship, Elsa stretched out her hands and willed the Mirror to return.

It was a familiar process by now, though jarring at first. All the congregated whispers of the Mirror shards threatened to drown out her own thoughts, but she'd learned how to silence them. Suppress them, Markus had taught her, and she could control their power. It came naturally. It was the easiest thing in the world to summon the shards, and assimilate them, as though they were eager to return. Elsa remembered what the trolls had said, of course. Perhaps the shards really _were_ eager.

Elsa had spent the last few days with Markus, the two of them slaughtering their way through various small kingdoms near the Southern Isles. She had skipped over them before, instead focusing on the larger shards that were readily sensible. All that these places had to offer were barely splinters and dust at best, but together, they yielded some minimal progress.

A palm-sized fragment rested in her hand now, the collected residue from their work, and Elsa stared into the clear surface, stared into her own eye and saw–

_"Elsa! Honey, what are you doing hiding away in there?"_

_"I don't want to hurt you."_

_"You could never hurt me. We're family, Elsa. We're here for each other. Everything will be okay."_

Elsa jerked away, free hand flying up to cover her eye, but nothing could stop the incessant twitch. It felt like a spike was being driven through the back of her skull, slowly drilling through to her eye socket.

"Are you well, child?" Markus asked, stepping forward.

"I'm fine." Elsa pushed the shard away, though even without magnetism, it seemed bound to her touch and returned. Fighting past its resistance, Elsa finally willed the shard to levitate towards Markus's waiting palm. "I don't know why these pieces keep showing me my family. None of it makes sense."

"…Oh?"

"It's nothing like what I remember happening," Elsa said, unable to keep the frustration from her voice. She didn't need to see tantalizing images. None of them were real. "Didn't you say that the Mirror gives us what we desire? Hah. Maybe I still desire acceptance from my family."

"We are your family now," Markus said, stretching out his hand to cradle her face, and Elsa leaned gratefully into his touch. "And we will always welcome you, Elsa."

"…Thank you." Elsa steadied herself to stand on her own, spirits rising when she saw Markus smile with approval. "But words will never be enough; I cannot thank you enough for everything, Markus. You saved me. You taught me. You gave me a home when I lost mine."

"And you have repaid me in full." Markus turned away. Walking to the gunwale, he gripped the edge and leaned over to the sea. "Truly, I love you like a daughter, Elsa. No one else has given me the same loyalty. You are the only one who has never failed me."

"And I don't intend to ever fail you," Elsa said.

"…I have never doubted you." Facing her again, Markus opened his mouth to say something, but he seemed to decide better of it and simply nodded. "I'll leave you to rest, then. We have many more things to accomplish."

Markus departed for the cabin, leaving Elsa to enjoy the sea. She closed her eyes, feeling the rocking of the ship, hearing the slamming of the waves, smelling and tasting the salt of seawater. All of it was magnified until the vibrations shook her body and the drumming pounded in her ears. Too chaotic for most people to enjoy, but Elsa liked the distraction, the sense of total immersion. Not one of her senses went unused, save for sight.

Without this, sometimes she feared she would drift away.

* * *

Anna sat at the beach where she and Elsa had arrived to Arendelle.

It was getting too cold for anyone else to be out and about, but that suited Anna. She pulled her cloak close and stared into the sea, the sunset on the horizon lighting the water with orange and purple hues. Like a symphony coming to a close, the light died down more emotional and more beautiful.

She remembered dancing with Elsa here.

Elsa had been _good_ at it too, good enough that now Anna suspected she rather enjoyed dancing. Maybe she had learned how to do it formally after going to the Southern Isles, but maybe Elsa had always liked dancing. It suited her, actually. It suited that bright-eyed child Anna had seen, to move without restraint, to let emotion wash over her and dance without thought.

She really ought to have asked.

* * *

Elsa directed lightning towards her enemies as she twisted through a barrage of metal.

Blades speared through the air from every direction, but she never paused, only weaved between them, feet always pivoting, turning, spinning this way and that as lightning burst from her hands. She wasn't wielding a weapon anymore. She'd lost it sometime during the fight, but lightning was more than enough. It seared through the armor of anyone unfortunate enough to be in her line of sight, tore apart steel and flesh, but Elsa took no pleasure in the carnage.

She focused on the dance. She kicked up and leaned back to avoid a blade, retaliated with a swift lightning strike. Before the body hit the ground she was already back in motion, dodging, flipping, weaving through enemy ranks. Keeping one hand low to the ground, Elsa fired off a constant stream of cold air that rocketed her around the battlefield, and surrounded by a web of electricity, she was untouchable. Lightning arced off the shield and struck anyone close, even as pirouettes bore her away.

_Mamma was watching from inside the house, and Elsa could imagine her proud smile._

_She danced with Pappa in the garden, clumsily imitating those grand dances she had only heard of but never seen in person. Elsa was having the time of her life. Pappa would raise their linked arms, and every time she would twirl, braid swinging through the air and smacking into her Pappa's belly, and Elsa laughed when he pretended to be hurt._

_"You're very good at this," Pappa said._

_"One day I'll learn how to do it for real!"_

Elsa danced again, lightning and ice her partners now.

* * *

Anna walked into the marketplace, joining the growing bustle.

She could smell the chocolate in the air, mixed with the wafting fragrance of fruits and other sweets. It filled the air so heavily that anyone walking through would be intoxicated on the heady aroma. Every type of smell was here: the sugary sweetness of cinnamon, the sharp tang of peppermint; the syrupy zest of caramelized honey, the creamy softness of vanilla; and the rich smoothness of chocolate.

She remembered how much Elsa loved chocolate.

It'd been such a surprise to find that the cold queen had a sweet tooth, one almost as bad as her own. Worse, even, in some ways. Elsa pretended so often that she had moved on from her childish likings, but once she got started on chocolate, she hoarded the stuff, like she could never have enough. Anna practically had to drag her away sometimes. Even if she told anyone, Anna thought, trying not to laugh, no one would ever believe that Elsa could be so bratty.

Why had she stopped, Anna wondered.

* * *

Everything tasted like blood.

Even when the air became so saturated with blood that it left a taste on her tongue, Elsa didn't mind the copper tang in her mouth. It wasn't the taste of death. Blood was something warm, and alive. She'd gotten used to smelling and tasting blood long before, back when she felt it run from the body of her parents and onto her hands, dying her skin dark red. What frightened her most was it all stopped.

She flung icicles down from the sky, each one as thick as an arm and filed to a point, spinning in spirals like drills. She grew trees of ice from the earth that burst through the cracked earth, like she could really create life. Mangled bodies were strung in the air, suspended on the thick spikes. She grew a forest of penitentes, each one bearing its own victim, each one reddened by the blood flowing down in rivulets.

_"We have a surprise for you!"_

_Elsa closed her eyes, squealing when Pappa covered them with his hands because he knew she would peek otherwise. Mamma had prepared something for her birthday, but even if she couldn't see, she could guess. She could smell it from a mile away. Elsa pretended to be surprised anyway when the small cake was revealed, something humble and barely enough to be more than four, maybe five bites, because she wanted Mamma and Pappa to know how happy she was regardless._

_"Let's share it," Elsa suggested._

_She dug into the cake, cutting through the icing-snowflake, and passed out the pieces. When she bit into the chocolate and the sweetness filled her senses, she grinned, chocolate dotting her teeth._

Nothing was sweet anymore. It only ever tasted of metal.

* * *

Anna maneuvered through the crowd to get close to the vendors.

Standing at the exact same spot as before was the merchant selling toy swords, and as usual, there was a gaggle of children boisterously claiming their valor and pretending to be knights. Another vendor had lanterns with riddles scribed on the paper, and next to him, a merchant advertised lutefisk and other similarly tasteful snacks next to the jars of fermented fish.

And the same boy selling flowers was wandering around too, offering his basket to passersby.

When he spied her across the street, his eyes brightened. When he noticed that Elsa was nowhere to be seen, his expression became crestfallen, and Anna tried her best to smile. She shook her head when the boy lifted up his basket of blue orchids. None of them could survive in winter anyway. Elsa might have grown them, once, but those flowers would wilt in the cold.

They were incompatible now.

* * *

Elsa formed a sword and carved a swath through the opposing soldiers, most of whom feared her too much to even fight back, instead trying to flee and still dying by the dozens.

She impaled a man through the back while he ran, and she ignored his choked scream when she flung him aside. Cut out their legs, use the same motion and bring the sword up, pivot to the side, block the back, swing around and cut again. Never let them come close. Only she could injure, maim, kill. Swords of ice materialized from thin air, impaling several others and pinning them to the ground. Elsa ran through the battlefield, exchanging swords as she went, throwing out the ones with blunted edges for newer weapons that she ripped out of the fallen.

Somewhere behind the haze of bloodlust, Elsa recognized that she was being more brutal than she needed to be. But as her blade pierced through her enemies and carved through armor and flesh, she found she didn't care anymore. All the blood that had been frozen in her veins now sang at this violence, hummed in excitement, and she was more alive than she had ever felt before.

_"Mamma! Look!"_

_Elsa waved her toy wooden sword about, watching frost grow on the garden in the same path as its trajectory. Mamma looked out the window and sighed, striding out the door with her hands on her hips._

_"Elsa, you need to be careful," Mamma said, kneeling down so their eyes met, and, young as she was, Elsa could see the seriousness of her gaze. She pointed at the flowers beginning to sag from the weight, curl from the cold. "See? They don't like to be cold. They can't survive like that."_

_"Oh." Elsa hung her head. "I guess I just ruin things now."_

_"No!" Mamma said this so vehemently that Elsa jumped. "No, Elsa. You could never ruin anything."_

_"But…the flowers…"_

_"You'll find a way to make things work." Mamma smiled while fixing a strand of her hair behind her ear. "Your powers are a part of you, Elsa, but they're not everything about you either. You'll find a way."_

It took her this long to realize there had never been a way.

* * *

Anna stepped inside the castle at the end of the day.

She had pursued this same routine for days and days now, going out and wandering about, looking at sights that she had seen with Elsa, looking at sights that she _wanted_ to see with Elsa. She was always thinking about what the trolls had told her, but she never visited them again. She had no answers yet. Looking for them in those places had been useless. How could revisiting memories be helpful? It would just hurt more. But those memories that surfaced – Anna treasured every one. It didn't hurt. She wanted to remember, hold on tight and never forget the warmth of Elsa's embrace. She was never cold.

Every day when Anna returned to the castle, she would ascend the stairs but walk past her own room, just a bit, before doubling back. Every day, she would go just a little farther, and farther, and farther. Until today, her feet led her to the elaborate doors that led to where Elsa had lived for those few days, when everything seemed perfect and nothing could go wrong.

After a moment of hesitation, Anna pushed the doors open.

She had never been inside.

Everything was untouched.

Anna swept her gaze over the grand room. There were even creases on the bed where Elsa had last sat, a cup with long-stale water on the bedside counter, some books cracked open on the desk. No one had been in here since their separation. Elsa had been the last person in this room, and for some reason that realization left tears burning in Anna's eyes. She took in the room with longing, drinking in the sight for other signs of her existence. Nothing hung in the wardrobe; Anna remembered how Elsa had been very proud of her ability to create her own clothes. Next to the books on the desk –

Anna froze. Sitting on the desk was the blue orchid she had bought for Elsa.

Hardly daring to believe her eyes, Anna tread closer, shaking hands reaching out for the flower that had survived against all odds. When her fingers traced the petals, Anna realized there was a thin layer of ice molded over the smooth blades, even the stem and leaves, keeping the flower preserved, protected inside a crystalline copy.

"I shouldn't have tried to fix you," Anna whispered. "I shouldn't have tried to change you."

Because that _was_ what she had been doing. She had tried to change Elsa, to _fix_ Elsa, into someone easier for her to love. She had told Elsa not to throw away who she had used to be, but only because she couldn't bear to love the person Elsa was now. Because she couldn't accept the side of Elsa that she hid behind now, any more than Elsa could accept the person she had been. But there wasn't a difference between them. They were the same person, Elsa and the Queen.

She had forgotten that Elsa was so much more than just the sum of her problems, that beneath the troubled exterior, she had never changed. She had forgotten that Elsa was still that mischievous girl who led her through the forest, the one who loved chocolate and building snowmen. Elsa was still the girl who would preserve something as simple as a flower, because it reminded her of home, and because Anna had gifted it to her.

Elsa had never needed to be fixed.

_I can be your heart…_

Elsa had never needed her to be her heart. She had one of her own. Nothing could replace that.

Anna nearly crushed the blue orchid in her grasp.

"Anna!"

Anna turned as Agdar burst into the room, eyes alight with feverish energy.

"Elsa has declared war on Arendelle."
