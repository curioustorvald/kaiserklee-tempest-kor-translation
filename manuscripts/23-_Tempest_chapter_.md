**Chapter 23: Day Three, 0 Hours Remain**

With her magic speeding their travel, Elsa led her troops through the inlet in record time, sleighs silent and undetectable on her crystal runway. Once they penetrated the bay they abandoned the sleighs and veered south on foot, taking cover in the shadow of lush forests. Fog had obscured their advance, and now thick evergreen canopies hid them from whatever guards might be posted at the city walls. It was unlikely they would be vigilant in their watch at any rate, complacent and bloated on excess.

With the foliage covering their approach, Elsa moved closer to the edge of the forest. Before long she could see the castle gates standing only a hundred meters away, bearing flags that swayed in the wind. Behind her, Kristoff shifted and smoothed Sven's pelt in repetitive strokes.

"Stay here when it starts," Elsa said, eyes never leaving the gates, calculating the distance and visualizing the trajectory of her powers. "This will be over quickly."

"Uhh, right, I'll just stay out of the way. Although…" Kristoff scratched the back of his neck and fell silent.

"Speak," Elsa said. She never meant for her voice to be so imperious, but here, in the familiar battlefield that was her domain, she always spoke in clipped tones. Time was better spent on strategy than banter.

"Is Anna okay with this?" Kristoff asked.

"We have discussed it," Elsa said. Even if much of their discussion had been nonverbal, they understood one another. She had promised. Anna had compromised. This was necessary and would not come between them. "Which is why no blood will be spilt."

Elsa dismissed Kristoff with a wave of her hand, pretending not to notice how the man jerked away instinctively – not from fear but appropriate wariness – and turned to the small number of troops at her command. She would not need many men. She might have sieged Weselton herself if not for appearances. It was one thing to destroy a kingdom in a dramatic show of might, but to infiltrate alone in the manner of an assassin was distasteful.

"You are not to use deadly force, but at the same time you do not need to fear retaliation. I will protect you from harm," Elsa said. Sparks crackled at her fingertips, and the men snapped into a salute.

Elsa looked back to the castle gates, feeling the cold swirl of her powers churn under her skin, begging to be released as they never were now. It was still there, that violent instinct that was almost an addiction. It thirsted for blood. Repressed, desperate for an outlet, but not even here could she afford to allow her powers free reign. It was likely she never would again.

But Markus had taught her not to limit herself…

Elsa blocked out all other thought and pushed forward. Ice flowed from her hands in an ever-expanding stream, molding into a staircase that stretched farther and farther, until it finally slammed into the top of the gates with a booming crash that shook the very foundations of the castle walls. And there was silence. Bits of shattered stone fell to the earth, the walls as feeble as rotten wood before her powers.

"Go," Elsa said.

Barely a moment passed before her soldiers were sprinting up the staircase, protected by a moving half-dome that protected them from assault, but only when they were halfway up did the guards respond at all, firing ineffectual arrows that bounced off her shield. Elsa followed behind at an easy pace, watching with a careful eye as her men swarmed over the walls and disarmed the guards. They were too afraid of her to disobey, but their weapons had been blunted anyway and her wintry winds followed each one to intercept deadly strikes if necessary. Elsa was more concerned with any guards who might sound alarms.

There was one.

It took great force of will to resist the lightning surging only a heartbeat away, but instead Elsa flung out her arm and launched a mixture of snow and ice that simply knocked the guard unconscious. Bruised and battered, but alive. She continued on her way and stepped over the walls just as her soldiers finished incapacitating the Weselton guards, leaving a slew of unconscious bodies behind them.

"We head for the barracks," Elsa announced.

She took point once again, slipping through the southern portion of the city and still undetected. Part of the river ran through the city, and she saw the dam that she might have once attacked from, a single bolt of lightning enough to tear into the metal and straight through the exposed stonework. Now, she only froze the river and bridged the water, then continued on foot through the darkened city. Elsa stood at the center of an invisible circle, and within a twenty-foot radius light snow fell. There was the occasional patrol, but she always sensed them long before they ever saw her, forewarned by the snow acting as her eyes and ears. It was easy enough to disable the guards before they could make a scene.

It had been the dead of night before, the streets empty save for the occasional drunkard or stray animal, but as Elsa made her way through the city, darkness began to give way to day. That was fine. She arrived at the barracks just as the first light of dawn struck the city, giving her plenty of time before the soldiers inside woke. She placed her hand over the door to an individual barracks unit, clenched down on the knob, and ice spread over first the metal railings and then the wooden frame.

Out the corner of her eye she saw her own soldiers unnerved by the display, but she diverted her attention to the creeping frost leaping from building to building, sealing each one so that the soldiers within couldn't come out. It was for their own good. Now they couldn't exit to their deaths. And without interruption…

Elsa turned her gaze to the castle.

* * *

"Anna. Wake up. Anna! Are you in there? Anna!"

At the repeated call of her name followed by several thuds, Anna jerked awake. It was Alek she heard pounding away at the door, but it took a moment longer for her to recognize her surroundings. She was back in her new room, lying comfortably in bed and not standing petrified at a dead end. Except she had no recollection of ever returning. How had she made it back?

"J-Just a minute!" Anna called back when Alek continued knocking. She kept a tight grip on her blankets, struggling to control her ragged breathing. Her thoughts flew back to the previous night, but try as she might to wrack her brain, there were gaps in her memory. No matter how hard she reached, she could only grasp at darkness.

Numbly, Anna rose and trudged to the door, opening it to be greeted by a deathly pale Alek.

"What the hell took so long? I thought you died last night and nobody would ever answer," Alek growled, dragging a hand through his hair so roughly his nails likely dug into his scalp.

"S-Sorry," Anna said.

Alek paused mid-step through the door, angry expression giving way to confusion. After all, Anna always used to banter back. She couldn't find the peace of mind to do it this time. "Did something happen? You sound…weird," Alek said. Anna shrugged and Alek exhaled a long breath. "Look, I'm sorry I blew up at you. I was worried. If anything happened, that would be my fault for leaving you–"

"I don't remember how I got back," Anna said.

"…Oh. That's not good," Alek said. Carefully, he sat Anna down at the edge of the bed and kneeled to examine her more closely. "You look fine, just a little shaken up. How do you feel?"

"I think I might have heard the Sorcerer," Anna murmured, bowing her head when the pressure of it all became too much. Whatever hypnotic properties his voice had was still drugging her mind. It felt like oil sliding under her skin, fingers tugging at her nerves, restless agitation pulling her in all directions. "And then I just woke up here. Otherwise, I-I think I'm okay. I mean, I don't know but I hope–"

Alek gripped Anna by the shoulders and forced her to meet his eyes. "You _are_ okay."

"What if something is messed up inside me?" Anna breathed.

It was vile. It was violation in every sense of the word and left her feeling unclean beneath her skin. Just the thought that someone might have been in her head made her stomach churn. Not even the sanctuary of her mind was safe. Was she brainwashed? Could she trust her actions to be her own?

"We don't even know how the Sorcerer's powers work. Don't freak yourself out," Alek said firmly, brushing Anna's hair back and cradling her head. "I'll be here. I'll be watching out for you."

"Th-Thanks," Anna whispered.

"Maybe you need some fresh air," Alek suggested.

Anna nodded and went into the adjoining restroom, splashing her face with water and staring at her reflection in the mirror. It was only her face that stared back, droplets of water sliding down the bridge of her nose. Not a shadowy figure or reddening eyes. She was fine. After a few minutes of freshening up, she followed Alek out. Maybe Alek had a point. As soon as she left her room and stretched her legs, her fears were relieved somewhat. She really was fine. Her thoughts were her own. Surely being able to feel panic at all was a good sign?

"Are we going to keep searching? You said we'd look around town," Anna said. Best to keep her mind occupied. As long as they kept moving, everything was fine.

"Yeah. I tried to recruit some of the soldiers who were most loyal to me, but they all seemed…strange. Something in their eyes was different, hazy, so that's why I checked you earlier," Alek explained, and Anna felt another surge of relief. "I probably don't have to tell you this, but they all rejected me."

"We're going alone, then." Anna wondered about openly flaunting Saul's decree about her staying locked up, but she supposed Alek must have figured it all out. But then again, the hotheaded blond was prone to being rash and she didn't want him getting into even more trouble. "About Saul…"

"Saul's missing," Alek said, sounding entirely flippant but nearly causing Anna to trip over air. "Probably since early in the morning, because I tried to find him first thing but no sign of him anywhere."

"That's bad too!" Anna exclaimed. "Shouldn't we look for him?"

"Considering I'm almost positive that something is up with him, this works out fine. Chances are that he'll turn up safe and sound." Alek pushed the main doors open to the courtyard, where a pitch-black stallion was already waiting. Anna thought it looked vaguely demonic at first, but on closer inspection it was a gentle thing and neighed softly to welcome them.

Alek insisted on helping Anna up even though she flatly told him she knew perfectly well how to ride, and then off they were to the castle town. Outer sector, Alek had said, and it took a decent time before they arrived; Anna lost track halfway through the bumpy ride, being forced to close her eyes to guard against the blinding effect of sunlight reflecting from snow. It was a shantytown held together by tape and prayers. The nicer homes had slowly transitioned to more rundown counterparts, blackened by filth and practically a blight against the purity of snow.

"How come things are this bad here?" Anna asked.

"A lot of these people are small-time criminals, but…" Alek sighed. "Well, the other reason you're here is if you were poor and couldn't afford better. Not like money is worth anything now, but you know discrimination. People stayed where they were before the big freeze."

"How do they even keep warm?" Anna murmured. Garbage and trash were often substituted for proper foundations and walls.

"They get by." Alek dismounted and extended a hand for Anna, but this time she hopped off without his assistance. At the quiet snub, Alek stuck his hand in his pocket. "We should ask around."

"Assuming anyone is willing to talk to you." Anna clenched her fist. "You know why people are missing from only this area? Because whoever's doing it knows that no one cares. Like you don't care."

"Anna…" Alek bowed his head for a fraction of a second, but then he lifted his head again and his lips were set into a scowl. "You haven't said anything against Elsa. She lets this happen."

"She didn't know–" Anna closed her mouth when Alek raised an eyebrow. It was true. Elsa didn't know about the disappearances, but she had to have known about the state of things here.

Anna pursed her lips, strode to the nearest home, and knocked on the door. But when a man missing several teeth opened the door, he took one look at her and slammed the door again. She turned to Alek in question. Surely they should have been more receptive of her? Walking the barren streets, they passed a woman hurrying by with her unhappy child, desperately trying to keep his crying at bay. Before Anna could say a word, the woman had fled into her home and locked the door.

When they knocked on doors, there was only a one in ten chance anyone would open up. No one had even actually spoken to them yet, only slammed the door in their faces after one quick look at them. Several failed attempts later, Alek finally became fed up. Stalking up to yet another ramshackle home and drawing his sword, Alek sliced the feeble door apart before Anna could even cry out for him to stop. There was a man inside, similarly weather-beaten as the rest they had seen, and this time Alek walked in and grabbed him by the collar to pull him close.

"Don't hurt him!" Anna said.

"Answer what I ask, and you'll be fine," Alek said. With that he threw the man away, and he landed on the floor in a harsh tumble. Anna rushed forward to pull Alek away, but the prince only shrugged her off and held her back, ignoring her punches against his arm. "Someone was taken from here, right?"

"M-My daughter." Anna held back a gasp as someone finally spoke, and though the man's voice was a croak, hearing anybody was almost surreal.

"Tell us everything," Alek said, almost gently, and Anna stopped trying to punch at him. Whatever he was doing, it was working.

"We just want to know the circumstances," Anna added. Alek turned to raise an eyebrow at her, but when she shifted he let her go. Anna helped the man up from the floor and gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. "Maybe something will help us find your daughter. That's all we want. We promise."

"Th-There's not much to tell. It happened in the middle of the night. You can see this place for yourself. Not much room. We were both here." At the man's beckoning, Anna looked around. True to his words, there was barely enough room for the three of them as it was. Not much in the way of furniture, only a wooden table with a candle in the middle, stools, makeshift bedrolls in the corner.

"And then?" Alek asked.

"She'd found something in the snow that she wanted to show me. Probably some sort of trinket, not very special, but…" His lips tilted into a sad smile as he added, "She had an eye for things. Strangely shaped rocks. Oddly colored bark. She just loved everything in the world." The man's voice began to crack and his eyes became unfocused. Anna had to look away. He sounded so defeated. "She came back inside. Candle flickered out, and by the time I could light it again she was…she was…gone."

They wouldn't get anything more out of the man, and even if they could, Anna didn't think she had to heart to keep questioning him. There was nothing she could say to comfort him either. She left slowly and quietly, pulling on Alek's arm so that he followed her out, and she carefully shut the door behind.

It was a quiet trek through the snow as they wandered aimlessly for a little while, some half-formed thought like looking for clues floating through Anna's mind, but she was really much more distracted by the raw emotion she had just witnessed. Suddenly, this whole thing became real. People were vanishing into thin air, and worse, they were being kidnapped.

"How did you know to do that?" Anna asked at last. "You know, that you would get him to talk if you were a little rougher."

Alek shrugged. "How else would he think we could do anything to help? Out here, you need to prove yourself. You did well yourself, though. Nice touch with the empathy."

"I meant it," Anna said.

"I know, and that's why it works," Alek said. "If you were lying, you might fool some people but the others can tell. But you…you never fake anything. People can feel that and trust you instinctively."

Before Anna could respond, she was interrupted by the crunch of hooves powering through snow. As the sound grew louder, Anna turned in its direction and saw a glimpse of a familiar white horse. Before she could tell who it was, Alek grabbed her arm and practically threw her behind him. In front of them, the horse slowed and its rider dismounted. Immediately, Alek drew his sword, the metal coming free from its scabbard with a hiss.

"Hans!" Anna said, standing on tiptoes to peer over Alek's shoulder. It was indeed the thirteenth prince, garbed in a grey winter cloak and approaching with his hands raised, keeping them away from the sheathed sword hanging from his belt. "What are you doing here?"

"What _are_ you doing here?" Alek repeated, his voice much more vicious.

"Alek, put the sword away, please," Anna said, but only when Alek ignored her plea did she remember – Alvard had written that he spoke to Hans not long before his death. Despite whatever Alek said about not suspecting anyone, Hans was already guilty in his mind.

Hans shook his head at Anna then said, looking directly at Alek, "You should know better than anyone that no one is allowed to simply leave the castle without permission."

"Trying to cover your tracks?" Alek asked.

"Hardly. I'm here to help you find them," Hans said.

Alek was so disarmed his grip slackened for a fraction of a second, but when Hans stepped closer, he quickly jerked his sword towards his younger brother. "Explain. Now."

"You two are investigating Alvard's death. Let's say that I have vested interest," Hans said, now stepping so close that Alek had his sword hovering only an inch away from his throat. "Something is going on that I'm unaware of, and I don't like being in the dark."

"That's not good enough," Alek said.

"You'll just have to trust me." Ignoring Alek's fervent denial, Hans looked over him and to Anna again, meeting her eyes with a heavy gaze. "Do you trust me, Anna?"

It might have been too convenient for Hans to show up just as they were on the cusp of discovering something. It might have even been too convenient _yesterday_ for Hans to be there to help her, but Anna trusted her instincts. It was like Edmund would say. Vibes. She did trust Hans for whatever reason, maybe because she had seen him vulnerable, maybe because he wasn't entirely perfect.

"I do," Anna said. When Alek's head whipped back, she said again, "I trust Hans. I think we should let him help."

"Anna, that is a _stupid_ decision and we both know it," Alek hissed.

"It's not. You said it yourself that I can't even trust you completely," Anna pointed out, and Alek stilled. She didn't mean it in a hurtful way. She kept her tone even, but Alek had to understand. "If I'm out here all alone with you…I may as well have someone else around. And if Hans is a danger, then I have you."

"Anna is smarter than you," Hans said, lip curling, but Alek didn't offer any retort. Instead, he lowered his sword slowly, reluctantly, before sheathing it again in one lightning-quick motion. Hans scoffed and tied Sitron to a nearby post, giving the horse a pat on his head before returning.

"You didn't bring any of the guard?" Alek asked.

Hans snorted. "None of them will listen to me. I was given your post so that a target could be painted on my back, no other reason. Are you going to tell me what exactly you're doing out here?"

"No," Alek said, just as Anna responded, "We're looking into some disappearances."

"Funny, I was looking into a disappearance of my own. I'm sure Reid was headed this way," Hans said.

As Alek reluctantly filled Hans in on the situation, careful to avoid any talk of the Sorcerer and not even trying to make up some excuse that linked the disappearances to Alvard, Anna wrinkled her nose at the thought of being anywhere near Reid, that awful rat-faced brute. But it _was_ interesting that he was also headed this way. It had to be connected somehow. Before she could think on it more, Anna was distracted by the two princes talking rather animatedly.

"With the number of people taken and how often, they have to be kept somewhere close by," Hans said. "It really shouldn't be that hard to find."

"Assuming that it's above ground," Alek said. "But that would be obvious. No one smart enough to pull all this off would ever do something that stupid."

"But it narrows our search field to where the most kidnappings take place. If we can find out some more about how the culprit behaves–"

"We can probably trace him by pattern," Alek finished, and Hans nodded in agreement.

Anna looked from Alek to Hans, unable to stop herself from grinning at the odd sight and drawing their attention when she laughed. "You know, you two work pretty well together."

Alek looked away, scowling at nothing in particular, and Hans took a deep breath before asking, "Where haven't you two been? I can help with questioning–"

"Hans actually being helpful?" Alek snorted.

"I don't know, Hans _is_ easier on the eyes than you. Try not scowling as much," Anna said, giving Alek a gentle pat on the arm when he grumbled. "Maybe we won't get kicked out as often now."

It was hours before they made any progress, but after careful questioning of families in the vicinity, Anna and the two princes pinpointed where the majority of the kidnappings took place.

Having Hans around really did make the process quicker, since he possessed natural charisma far surpassing Alek, and along with Anna, the two made a powerful team. Mostly they were told similar accounts of the missing persons being taken at night or vanishing without a trace, but one fact was strangely consistent. All of those abducted were older dark-haired men or younger blonde women, the youngest only a child of eight. Anna had needed to walk away while that particular story was being recounted to them.

"Too bad Elsa is in Weselton. We could have used her as bait," Alek said.

Anna frowned. "That's not funny."

"Actually, Alek makes a fair point," Hans said. Anna whirled around to face him, but Hans bore through her angry retort before countering, "It might be possible that these people are being targeted _because_ they resemble Elsa. She has enough enemies. Of course, this is all hypothetical."

"On second thought, Elsa would make horrible bait," Alek said. "Hate her all you want. No one in their right mind would try to take her."

"Can we stop talking about this and try to figure out where we should be looking?" Anna asked. When Alek and Hans weren't making passive aggressive remarks at each other, they were oddly in sync.

"It's not hard to figure out, considering where we are," Alek said.

Anna followed the direction of where his finger pointed, over the barren treetops to large wood-and-steel complexes at the docks. Warehouses. It was an easy trek over, and moving a little further from the shantytown, they saw more people outside. Not many, but some children ran about playing and there were workers and guards at the warehouses. Overall, here it felt more like an actual town than a haunted one, albeit cursed by eternal winter.

Hans took the lead and strode past the children to the workers at the docks. Unlike the children they recognized Hans and Alek as royalty, and at the sight of the princes they immediately stiffened. Alek approached one and impatiently waved his hand, but he only tensed more.

"I-Is something wrong, Your Highness?"

"At ease," Hans said. He outstretched a hand towards Alek, but the blond only glared until Anna cleared her throat. Reluctantly, Alek handed over the file and Hans showed it to the worker. "Do you know any of these people?"

Such disdain grew on the worker's face that Anna deemed him Ugly. "I'll be damned if I know them personally, Your Highness," Ugly said, looking as though he were resisting the urge to spit. "Scoundrels, the lot of them. I've seen them around the area but I always chase them away."

"They're people too," Anna said angrily.

"Just doin' my job, Ma'am," Ugly said, but his face grew pensive when he added, "Haven't seen many of them lately, actually."

"Because they're missing," Alek said, snatching the papers out of Hans' hands and stuffing them in his jacket again. "So just tell us whatever you know."

"Honest, I don't know much. Well, Old Man Norolf hasn't been around." Ugly frowned and lifted his hat to scratch the top of his head. "I think some of us might have actually reported him missing."

Anna peered over Alek's shoulder to look at the file and flipped a page. "Hey, there _is_ a Norolf here. And he's not one of your scoundrels?"

"Norolf used to work here too, until he decided to retire," Ugly said, scowling for a brief second before seeming to remember there were two princes around. "I-I mean, I think he might'a just wandered off somewhere else drunk, but the others were worried."

"Well, that explains why he's listed," Anna said. True, there were more disappearances than the file would suggest. Maybe the Sorcerer just thought no one would ever care enough about these beggars and scoundrels to report their disappearance…but some townsfolk had done just that. No matter what, these were still _people_ he took.

Just as Anna prepared to ask more, a ball sailed by and struck Ugly on the leg before bouncing off. When a laughing boy ran up to retrieve the ball, the worker stopped him and gave him a few choice words – Anna really hoped the boy wouldn't pick up on them – and, strangely, the boy retorted, "I hope the dock monster eats you!"

Anna noticed Hans narrow his eyes at the remark, but he did nothing to stop the child from leaving. Instead, Hans asked Ugly, "What's this about a dock monster?"

"Just an urban legend. Townsfolk probably noticing what you got there, Your Highness," Ugly said, pointing at the file. "And since people are missing around these parts…"

"They believe it the work of a dock monster," Hans finished. Giving Ugly a polite smile, he added, "That will be all. Thank you for your help."

After Ugly left, Alek said, "Guess we're on the right track."

"All urban legends are steeped in truth," Hans said. "We should look around these warehouses. Rule out any of the obvious ones with greater use, like the ones used to store weapons and rations–"

"Who made _you_ leader?" Alek asked.

Anna nudged his ribs and Alek subsided, still grumbling, but Hans made sense so they did as he said. Alek knew which ones to avoid, more familiar with the outfitting of the army and knowing which ones were used to stock provisions for that purpose. Scattered workers were busy sorting out rations and guards patrolled the area, but for the most part, the docks were in disuse. Compared to the bustle that must have been here when there had been active trade, this bare minimum of activity was nothing.

At least it made navigation easier, because it took barely any time at all to search through the warehouses. All of them so far had been completely ordinary, and though they made sure to check every inch for something suspicious, they found nothing. Lots of other things were interesting though.

"Check this out," Anna chirped, taking hold of a battle-axe from a rack of similar weapons.

"That thing weighs a lot more than you should be able to handle," Alek said, and even Hans gave pause at the sight of Anna swinging the gargantuan weapon like she did it every day.

After convincing Anna to drop the axe, Alek led them to another storeroom. Anna glanced at the neatly packaged squares covered in foil and hefted one, surprised to find it with quite a bit of weight. Hans let her know they were part of the rations passed out to the people of the Southern Isles, and eventually Anna gave in to curiosity and cracked one open.

"Tastes horrible," Anna said.

"Let me try," Hans said, looking every bit as curious as her, but one bite of the chunky block and he pressed it back into her hands.

After a few fruitless hours, they finally made their way to yet another warehouse, inconspicuous as the rest. Standard construction, a large complex made of pale wood painted dark red but framed with steel fixtures, curved roof reinforced by metal bars.

But here at last one thing was different.

"Hey, weird. No guards," Anna said.

Alek frowned and pushed open the heavy metal gates, but they were rusty compared to the others and opened with a grating creak. One look inside and the reason for the disuse and the lack of security became glaringly obvious. This warehouse was filled with summer goods: bathing suits, clogs, sun balms, all of it logoed with a trademark from some place called Oaken's Trading Post. Everything in here was contradictory to the winter weather outside.

"If there isn't something funny here, I'll eat my sword," Alek grumbled.

Anna was ready to walk in as they did all the other warehouses, but this time both Alek and Hans deliberately hastened their steps so they entered first, protecting her on either side. Shaking her head, Anna followed. Despite the impractical inventory here, nothing about the warehouse screamed sinister or anything even remotely suspicious. It was positively cheerful to see some variety of color outside the usual palette of white-blue-grey, though she could have gone without the snot-green of lutefisk floating in jars. After a good fifteen minutes of searching, they were still just as clueless as they were before.

"Maybe if I had a better view," Anna suggested.

Alek frowned. "What exactly are you thinking of–"

Without waiting for the others since she knew they would protest, Anna clambered atop some nearby boxes. They weren't exactly steady, but despite the already wobbling base Anna reached up to the next level of the messily stacked stock, fingers struggling to find purchase over the higher areas. Below, Hans bent his knees as though preparing to catch her, and Alek paced back and forth yelling insults at her.

"You're going to kill yourself!" Alek yelled.

"Just gonna block you out, I need to concentrate," Anna said.

She shimmied up the boxes, throwing her arms up onto the next box and pushing down to drag herself up, but her leg kicked frantically when she almost slipped. The tip of her boot smashed into an adjacent box and tipped it over, luckily not the one she had been standing on, but it still tumbled off the stack just as she pulled herself up. It hit the floor two meters below with a loud, hollow crash that echoed off the high walls of the warehouse.

Anna winced and looked down to see the box's contents spilled onto the floor, some sort of ceramic and metal fountain decoration. "Sorry about that! Are you two…all…right?"

Alek and Hans were staring at the spot where the decoration had hit, Alek with narrowed eyes and Hans with furrowed brow. Utilizing her new viewpoint for the first time and deciding that her quick scan of the warehouse from above really didn't help matters much, Anna slowly scaled her way back down, more interested in what exactly consternated the two princes.

"You don't think…?" Alek mumbled.

"Try it again," Hans said.

Alek drew his sword and tapped the spot, and Anna finally understood. It released such a hollow sound that it could not have been cement down beneath. There was empty space below them. They might have begun to search for a latch or a switch, but immediately a voice filtered through the air. Not deep as Anna had heard it before, overlaid by a shriller pitch so that it sounded like two voices working in tandem, and yet she could recognize it as the same one from the library, from behind the wall last night.

"Since you're here, you may as well come down."

There was a deep rumble and then Anna heard the sound of scraping stone. When she looked down, she saw the cement shifting, shadows bursting from cracks all along the floor. When they fell again, part of the floor had slid back, revealing a staircase leading down to unseen depths. Anna looked towards Alek, and then to Hans, and the resolve in her eyes stopped any argument they might have made for her to stay behind. Nothing would persuade her away from this.

She had to see him.

"Let's go," Anna said.
