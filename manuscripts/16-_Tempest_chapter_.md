**Chapter 16: Bite Like Chocolate**

Elsa woke to a gentle, rhythmic beat that filled her ears, the lulling sound easing into her consciousness. She became aware of a warmth pressed flush against her body, and as her mind gradually became alert, she realized her arms were wrapped around something. Or rather…someone. Her head rested against a shoulder and her arms encircled a slender waist, and as Elsa lay there quietly she felt the slow rise and fall of breathing. Arms enfolded her in return and held her gently, a cheek resting softly on her head.

_Anna_, Elsa recognized vaguely when memories of the last night came to mind.

They were both practically sitting on the bed, Anna leaning against the headboard at an uncomfortable angle. Elsa felt some soft fabric against her skin, but the sheets were tangled around her lower body. Anna was sitting without blankets or pillows, her thin nightshirt – the fabric Elsa had felt – the only thing keeping her warm. It was pale red and sheer, and barely reaching past the middle of her thighs. Anna had to be cold, especially lying so close to her. Elsa shifted away slightly and heard Anna stir.

"Elsa?" Anna mumbled.

Dropping her grasp, Elsa pulled away and shifted the blankets to cover Anna from the shoulders down. Blinking groggily, Anna sat up straight. Elsa looked away. There was silence, and Elsa didn't know what to say. There was nothing _to_ say, and contrary to her expectation, Anna said nothing either. If she was at a loss for words as well or maybe comfortable in the silence, Elsa couldn't tell without looking at her face. Still, Elsa could feel Anna's gaze on her, seeming neither embarrassed nor hesitant.

After the silence had drawn out, Anna said gently, "You were having nightmares again."

She remembered. Images still flickered through her conscience like scattering leaves caught in the wind, trapped and unable to settle. It had been many years since she had nightmares. When Markus first brought her back, Elsa dreamed every night of her parents and could hardly sleep at all. Her tactic then had been to train until she collapsed, too exhausted to bring up what plagued her, body too spent to even dream. Then after creating her reliquary, she could push the memories away as though they belonged to someone else. She hardly needed rest anymore, but when she did her sleep was dreamless.

Until they returned with piercing clarity now. Her memory of what happened after the balcony was hazy; Anna had guided her back, somehow. Even hazier was her recollection of what happened during that period caught between dreams and reality, neither less terrifying than the other, but Elsa remembered Anna crossing to her bed. Just Anna's presence had been enough to calm her, but now that she was awake and her mind was clear, she could recognize that _something_ had changed between them. Walls had fallen, and Elsa had no clue how to cope.

Elsa gave a noncommittal nod and rose from bed.

Or at least _tried_, because at the last moment Anna reached out to hug her waist and tugged her back. Elsa stumbled back to a seating position at the edge of the bed, gasping aloud at the sudden pull.

"You better not be all weird now," Anna grumbled against her back.

"I wouldn't dare," Elsa said, feeling her muscles relax as every bit of tension left her body just like that. It was just Anna. What exactly had she been worried about?

Hands slipping over Anna's and relishing the gentle warmth she always exuded, Elsa turned her head and smiled softly at the sight of Anna pouting. With her bottom lip jutted out and her hair tangled into a mess of red – with the one streak of white that Elsa was inordinately pleased to see – Anna looked…

"You're adorable," Elsa said.

The pressure around her waist tightened as Anna groaned, but after that last squeeze she let go and flopped onto her back. "You're making fun of me again. I know I look ridiculous."

"Maybe, but I can't imagine you prim and proper." Without thinking, Elsa leaned down and brushed her hand over Anna's hair, running her fingers through the bleached tress so that it straightened. It gave her an odd thrill to see Anna had kept the strand, though maybe the thought to cut it away simply hadn't crossed her mind yet. A part of Elsa still expected Anna to recoil from her touch, but she barely seemed to notice the dangerous proximity.

"Some princess I am, right?" Anna asked. Elsa paused. Apparently Anna _had_ noticed what she was doing, because she sat up looking bemused. "Hey, are you that ashamed of me?"

"Of course not. I was just distracted."

"Maybe you're still tired. I don't think you got much rest." Anna rose from bed – Elsa heard more than a few joints crack from her poor posture – and bounded to the bathroom, her voice filtering through the sound of running water. Warmed water, of course. Elsa had never cared about the temperature herself, but she had made sure the appliances were fitted with a gas furnace so Anna was comfortable. "Just lie down and get some more sleep!"

_I don't need it, I'm more worried about you_, Elsa wanted to say. She had slept well, better than she had in years, but Anna must have been uncomfortable.

Less than ten minutes later, Anna dashed out looking remarkably well-groomed for her previous dishevelment. "I'll be right back!" Before Elsa could say a word she threw a cloak over her nightshirt and was out the door.

"Where could you possibly be going?" Elsa murmured. She lifted a hand and rubbed at her temple, the beginnings of a migraine kindling at her skull. She had said she was distracted, but really it was the opposite. Her eyes had been opened, and her headaches had never been worse.

She had almost allowed herself to forget. Anna was not hers. Anna was Princess of Arendelle. She was only here because…

Elsa attempted to brush her disheveled bangs back, determined to push the thought away as long as possible. She had found her distraction at last. Without using her powers to freeze it in place, her hair refused to stay up, leaving the long tresses to frame her face. It was just as well. It gave her something to do, other than picking at the ends of her nightgown and wondering when she had changed into it.

"I'm back with breakfast!" Anna carted in a trolley, and the sight pained Elsa even as it warmed her. It shouldn't have fallen to her, this sort of work. Anna took one glance at her and asked, "What's wrong?"

Elsa shook her head. "Nothing."

Anna looked skeptical, but she didn't contest it. "Well, I brought us a ton of sweets!" She flipped the cover off to reveal an array of confections, the sweet tang of sugar palpable even in the air. "I've got cakes, truffles, caramel, fudge, and just lots and lots of chocolate–"

"How did you get this all so quickly?"

"Oh." Anna laughed nervously, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "I actually, uhh, prepared a lot of this for yesterday. But then…you know…the snowman…"

"We shouldn't waste it, then." Elsa swung her legs over the side of the bed, but Anna shook her head and she paused.

"Just stay there," Anna explained. She rolled the trolley closer and then jumped up into bed herself, snatching up a plate of chocolate – each one cut into a rounded snowflake – and setting it between them. "Now we're ready."

"We're going to get the sheets dirty," Elsa said gently.

"Are you calling me a slob?" Anna huffed.

"…No. And before you say it, yes, I admit I hesitated."

Anna looked torn between laughing and keeping up her show of displeasure, and when the giggle burst forth she tried desperately to stop it. Elsa heard a muffled noise that sounded like a cross between a screech and a snort, reminding her of a bird call. Anna widened her eyes in horror and blushed bright red, clasping her cheeks and biting her bottom lip. Elsa had noticed that habit a long time ago. It was something of a guilty pleasure to watch, especially when Anna poked her tongue out to wet her lips afterwards. Every time she did that, Elsa felt a curl in her stomach.

"That sounded gross," Anna groaned. She took off her cloak – Elsa averted her eyes politely – and laid it across the bed. "There, now we have like a picnic thing going on. No more about my awkwardness."

"Any hesitation on my part concerning that noise would be justified, I think." Elsa smiled wider when Anna hid her face. She picked up a chocolate and took note of its shape, similar to her own snowflakes. All of the chocolates were a little different, but so subtly that Elsa was sure they were _meant_ to be the same. Strange. She carefully placed it in her mouth and bit down.

Just once, and then Elsa stilled.

"You look really pained," Anna said, wincing. "A-Are they bad?"

"…Why do you ask?" Elsa rolled the chocolate around her mouth, pushing it to one side and suddenly thankful that she had no need to breathe. Some water might not be amiss. Her eyes flit around the room, but no such luck.

"I'm just going to try one." Anna took a chocolate snowflake, looked it over with all the professional air of a gold appraiser, and then threw it back. She bit down. Immediately her face paled, so badly she bore a passing resemblance to Elsa. She dashed over to a bin and spat the thing out with her tongue hanging out, face screwed up in agony. "That was disgusting! I think I used salt instead of sugar, ugh–"

"You made these?" Elsa asked. She swallowed. Not too bad. Something about the saltiness was novel, better than just mundane chocolate.

"Y-Yeah." Anna reached towards the trolley and slowly pulled out another plate. "Try this one instead?"

Elsa dutifully took another piece, a small globe of milk chocolate with a smattering of powdered sugar on top. She carefully took a bite. An explosion of flavor filled her mouth, and she put on a brave smile while swallowing as quickly as she could.

"Oh, you've got to be kidding…" Anna took a bite for herself before jerking the chocolate away, fixing it with a deeply offended glare, and then she shrieked, "I used spoiled milk? How is that even _possible_–?"

Elsa laughed as she had never laughed before, feeling stitches in her side – she had no idea how _that_ was possible when she didn't need air – and tears of mirth flow from her eyes. She couldn't have lowered her volume or covered her mouth as she had been taught even if she'd tried. Just the thought of Anna using _salt and_ _spoiled milk_ sent her into another bout of uncontrollable laughter.

"Hey! Y-You…" Anna broke down and laughed a little herself, shaking her head. "Okay, I deserved this one. Just wow. This is a new low for me."

"I do like the shapes," Elsa said, still chuckling. She took another piece.

Anna looked horrified. "You're not going to keep eating these? I'm going to give you food poisoning! I could kill you with bad chocolate!"

"If only it were that easy." Elsa winced through another round of salty chocolate mixed with a sour, moldy aftertaste, but she thought they were delicious all the same. When Anna tried to take them away, she grabbed the plate and set it back down. "You made these. I'm not throwing them out."

"Something always happens when I bring you food."

"I'm quite amazed you managed to find sour milk."

"I don't even…" Anna shrugged, and then sent her a pleading look. "I sort of expected this would happen – not the sour milk, exactly, but this _was_ the first time I tried making anything – so I asked the experts to make some just in case. Let's just eat the ones made by professionals, okay?"

After taking a moment to consider, Elsa decided to give in. After all, _she_ wouldn't get sick eating these, but Anna had no such protections. Knowing Anna, she would refuse to let her bear the burden of eating the poisoned chocolates alone, though Elsa honestly had no qualms about it. They were starting to taste delicious, actually. Must have been an acquired taste.

Elsa waved a hand over the two plates, carefully reining in her overflowing power to form a simple dome of ice around both. It was painstaking work siphoning off the excess charge, concentrating on letting the barest hint of her magic free, and she knew that any other day she would most likely have failed. But it was…easier, today. It reminded her a little of the past, when she could create anything she desired as though it were the most natural thing in the world. Just a _little_, but it was a cheering thought.

"Here's a triple chocolate fudge cake," Anna announced, having the decency to leave the monstrous cake on the cart and instead cut out a slice and slide it onto Elsa's plate. "Complete with chocolate icing and chocolate filling, then topped with chocolate strawberries and even more chocolate ganache."

"Isn't this a little excessive?" Elsa eyed the slice, unsure where to start.

"There's no such thing when it comes to chocolate."

Anna flourished her fork with considerable finesse – Elsa admitted some admiration of the easy way she handled the utensil, not unlike the way some might handle a sword – and speared the strawberry lying atop her slice. Elsa likewise stabbed into her own strawberry, though less dramatically. It really didn't taste any better than what Anna had made.

When she voiced her thought, Anna gaped. "You're insane. Mine tasted so bad compared to this, they have to be outlawed," Anna said, eating progressively larger bites and before long stuffing her mouth.

"You seem to be…enjoying yourself."

"Of course! Food tastes better when you just eat freely." Anna spun her fork in her hand in a perfect revolution. Elsa was no longer surprised by these feats of unexpected dexterity. "I've noticed that you eat really, really slowly, but it's hard to enjoy anything like that. You're being too careful."

"Then does speed mean something will taste more delicious?"

"Well, no." Anna's lips pulled down into a small frown while she thought. "It's just that if you put all your concentration into _how_ you eat, you can't appreciate _what_ you eat, right?"

"…I suppose this logic applies well in many situations," Elsa mused. It was sound advice; Anna was much more perceptive than even she gave herself credit for. Nodding, Elsa said, "I will endeavor to try it your way, then."

It had been the way she ate back then. Hearty meals of coarse food that she had still found delicious, eaten without a care for etiquette while her mother urged her to eat more. Chocolate had been a rare treat then, the expensive candy impractical for people of their status. But still, she hadn't bothered to savor it. She wolfed it down whenever she had the chance, letting the heady chocolate fill her senses completely. Elsa did that again. She let go of the restraint she had been taught and shoved half a slice of cake into her mouth.

Anna grinned when Elsa chewed soundlessly. "Good?"

"I see what you mean," Elsa agreed. She could actually taste the flavors now, _really_ taste the chocolate and not just remember the old sensations.

"Oh, but you've got a little…" Anna swiped her bottom lip with her pinky finger.

"Here?" Elsa licked her lip.

"No, more like _here_. Nope, still haven't gotten it. A little to the left, and…" Anna said, making more motions as Elsa tried to follow, before she stopped with a smile. "Actually, you know what? I got this."

"You've got what–"

Elsa barely held in a gasp when Anna reached forward and wiped the chocolate off for her, the pad of her thumb trailing over the corner of her lips. Her lips tingled where Anna had touched. To make matters worse, Anna was diligently rubbing back and forth to get the stain off completely. Elsa sat there still and mute, not daring to breathe. It was lucky that Anna didn't notice anything.

"You're eating like me," Anna laughed, eyes curving into crescents. She pulled away at last, but Elsa still felt her touch. Her skin burned feverishly.

"You _are_ a bad influence. First the others no longer knock on doors, and now my eating habits," Elsa said, grateful for the distraction.

"This reminds me a little of Arendelle," Anna said suddenly. "I would beg Pappa to have chocolate, and he'd always end up letting me but he just had to pretend otherwise first. Bad habits, he said."

Elsa stilled again, but the sensation was not half as enjoyable this time. She felt dread.

"…Do you miss home?"

"Well, yeah, of course," Anna shrugged.

"If you want…" Elsa said slowly, wondering about the phantom pang where her heart had been – only her imagination, most likely, because the alternative was impossible – but she had to say it anyway. It was only right. "You can go home."

Heavy silence stretched on as Anna blinked, but she never took her eyes off Elsa. "Go home?" Anna repeated, like Elsa had spoken in a foreign language. "Did you just tell me to go home?"

"There's no reason for me to hold you here." Elsa averted her eyes. It was the last thing she wanted. It was only fate that Anna leaving was also the _best_ thing. "I know that you miss Arendelle, and your father. It was wrong for me to take you away from your home and family, but I can fix all this–"

"You're an idiot."

Elsa's head snapped up, and she was greeted by Anna looking utterly furious. "I-I don't understand. It's for the best."

"You're right, I thought it was the cruelest thing possible when you took me away," Anna said, and Elsa nodded because she knew – only someone as depraved as she was could think of something like that – but Anna wasn't finished. "But you can't just expect me to just leave after everything that's happened!"

"Everything will go back to normal," Elsa said. "Nothing has changed. My offer still stands; I will continue to give Arendelle leniency. You can be home with your father, safe and at peace, and I will–"

"Be alone?" Anna challenged. Elsa looked away, unwilling to be swayed, but to her shock Anna took her hand and pressed it against her chest. She could feel the beating of her heart. Anna was there, a weak, pleading smile on her face. "Everything's changed, I can feel it. I know you don't want me to leave."

"…The only thing I'm afraid of is you leaving me," Elsa admitted. Just the thought of it was unbearable. Pushing Anna away was blotting out the little light she had left, but what else could she do? "But I won't stop you if you want to go home."

"Everything I said last night, I meant it," Anna said. "It's my choice, I _want_ to stay. Because…you're here."

Once more, Elsa felt the surge of emotion across the link of their hearts. It was so sinfully pleasurable it was almost painful; Elsa could feel everything Anna felt like a wave of liquid warmth flooding her veins. The intimacy of having Anna superimposed over her senses overpowered even the perpetual chill of her magic. Understanding. Acceptance. Love. Elsa closed her eyes and relished the feeling of completion.

It felt like the most natural thing in the world when Anna pressed her lips to hers.

* * *

It was a spur of the moment thing.

Anna saw Elsa close her eyes and the impulse came to her because now might be the best time, now or never because she might never again dare to try.

So Anna closed her eyes, leaned forward, and kissed her.

For all the hype and the big fuss people made about it, Anna thought, kissing someone honestly wasn't that great. There was a spark and a tingle where their lips touched, but there were no fireworks and no fanfare. Just about the only surprising thing was that Elsa's lips were warm and softer than anything Anna had ever felt, but she was so _stiff_, quite literally like a statue because for whatever reason she decided to stop breathing again. For a moment Elsa stayed so absolutely still that Anna was sure she had made a terrible mistake and that any second now, the queen would push her away. Better to do it herself and apologize. It would still be awkward, but hopefully less so.

Just as Anna started to pull away, disappointed by the response, Elsa tugged her back. Anna fell forward with a strangled squeal, ending up square in Elsa's lap and half-sprawled across her body, arms looped around her neck for balance. They were so close again that Anna could count the freckles dusting Elsa's nose, barely visible – not like hers– but so very there and so very human.

"Why did you stop?" Elsa asked, blinking slowly with an infuriatingly blank face. It was like she really had no idea what was wrong; Elsa looked so lost that Anna could have curled up and died. She knew the kiss was bad, but _that_ bad?

"I-I thought you didn't like it." Anna had intended to sound a little surer of herself, maybe a little more indignant, but of course her voice decided to crack. Anna cleared her throat. "You didn't do anything to make me think otherwise."

"I did, I-I was just surprised." Elsa exhaled and ran her hand through her hair. Anna blinked. Was she nervous? "But I would like to try again, if you were so inclined."

"If I were so inclined," Anna grumbled. "You're making this sound so official."

"I would like you to kiss me again," Elsa said.

She sounded like she was making a declaration and getting ready to march into battle. God, Anna had no idea anymore if Elsa was actually serious about _being_ serious or just making fun of her. Anna doubted the latter, but this whole thing was starting to feel more and more like one giant out-of-body experience. Maybe she was dreaming. Maybe she had drifted off after the chocolate and it was messing up her thoughts. Why would she hallucinate something so painfully awkward though?

"I'm just going to go for it," Anna mumbled.

"By all means."

"You're distracting me."

"My apologies. Should I stop talking?" Elsa asked.

"I'm just going to shut you out now because I need to concentrate."

Oh, to hell with it. Anna took a deep breath and mashed her lips against Elsa's, letting loose all her pent up frustration by kissing with all her strength, sitting up for better leverage. Where was she supposed to put her hands? Anna placed them on Elsa's shoulders to balance herself. She was pleased when she heard a muffled sigh, but Elsa _still_ wasn't giving the slightest hint she would participate. Anna kissed harder. And then pulled back, massaging her mouth.

"That hurt," Anna whimpered. They had bumped teeth.

"Ahh, so that wasn't supposed to happen," Elsa deduced, sounding pleased by her new-found knowledge. "Now we know, and we can move forward."

"You're supposed to kiss back," Anna snarled. This was ridiculous. Elsa _could not_ be this oblivious. Anna knew Elsa probably had no experience, but neither did she and even she knew how kissing worked!

"Understood."

"I'm going to kiss you again," Anna warned. "And you better give me some effort."

Anna leaned in and was relieved to see Elsa do the same, albeit with the sort of wariness expected from someone approaching a fire. She closed her eyes and tilted her head to the right, expecting to feel soft lips on hers again. Instead, her nose smashed into something hard and Anna reeled back with a pained cry. She almost fell out of bed, and would have if not for Elsa wrapping her arms around her waist and holding her tightly.

"You tilt your head the _other_ way." Anna rubbed her nose, noticing a small red spot growing on Elsa's nose and realizing they must have collided. "Maybe this wasn't such a good idea–"

"Or maybe I should take the lead."

Anna fought back a moan when Elsa kissed her at last. She had been wrong about kissing being boring, so wrong. Elsa was hesitant, barely brushing her lips over hers, but even that slight touch sent a jolt running down her spine and Anna was sure she would have collapsed if not for Elsa's hold on her waist. And when Elsa decided to be a little more forceful, kissing more insistently, catching her lower lip between hers and suckling softly…

She had never felt anything like this.

Anna felt so much pent up energy she could barely stay still, but at the same time she was frozen by shock and pleasure. Elsa was kissing her. Elsa was _kissing_ her, and it was the most amazing thing she had ever felt because Elsa was _accepting_ her and she could feel a warm glow pulsing through her heart. When Anna felt Elsa lightly nibbling, tongue prodding at her lips, she opened her mouth in a gasp. Anna had no idea where to put her hands before, but it was so natural to just rake her fingers through Elsa's hair when her tongue met hers. She was holding on for dear life when stars exploded behind her eyes.

"You are not participating," Elsa murmured.

Anna growled and kissed back. She wanted to be everywhere at once, hands pulling Elsa's hair free before making their way over her body, running over her back and tracing the curve of her waist, sliding under her nightshirt and feeling that familiar comfortable chill on her skin even as her lips burned hot. It was getting a little _too_ hot though. Anna vaguely remembered that Elsa had no need to breathe and that if she allowed it – which part of her yearned to – Elsa could keep kissing her for eternity.

Elsa must have realized too. She pulled away after pressing one last peck on the corner of her mouth, smiling softly and watching as Anna breathed deeply trying to recover.

"How are you so good at this?" Anna asked. Her hand shook on its way to her lips. Just a little swollen.

"Thanks to your instruction."

Oh, she was _definitely_ making fun of her this time. Elsa kept her face carefully neutral, but Anna could see the laughter in her eyes. Swallowing a retort, Anna opted instead to lean in again. This time Elsa fell backwards and pulled Anna close, laughing aloud when Anna let out a gasp at suddenly being on top.

"Kiss me again," Elsa said.

Anna spared a single sideways glance at the abandoned chocolate, but she forgot all about it when Elsa impatiently tilted her head back towards herself. She grinned and kissed Elsa again, and this time there was no bumping of teeth, no collision of noses and foreheads. She never thought she would think it, but chocolate could wait.

Anna could taste the chocolate on Elsa anyway, and it was a thousand times better this way.
