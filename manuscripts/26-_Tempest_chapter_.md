**Chapter 26: Fracture**

"For three days, I was absent from this kingdom," Elsa said, casting a frigid, baleful gaze around her court. "And what has transpired in these three days? Reid is dead, Hans is crippled. I might have been better served placing one of the kitchen hands in charge. What do you have to say for yourself, Saul?"

Where the princes stood at attention, heads bowed in deference, Saul was standing at his usual spot once more rather than seated on the throne. Elsa was back on her throne, and Anna stood at her right as she had once for Saul. Except this time, she watched the proceedings with vindictive pleasure. After everything that had happened – or perhaps because she needed to be _distracted_ from everything that had happened – Anna would be happy to see Saul get his comeuppance.

Saul stepped out of the line and tilted his head up to answer. Anna fought not to purse her lips at his calm countenance, still perfectly composed despite the charge.

"Your Majesty," Saul said, bowing, "I might have achieved better results had there not been insurrection among those present. If Your Majesty will allow it, I would explain in private."

"You think you have the right to demand things of me?" Elsa asked. Clutching the arm of her throne so tightly the skin of her knuckles turned white, Elsa leaned forward, unconsciously releasing a burst of cold air enough to lower the temperature in the throne room by several degrees. Windows frosted over, and even the points of the chandelier above them crystallized with tiny fractals of ice.

"A request," Saul corrected. "If I may, I believe it would to Your Majesty's advantage."

All at once, the cold receded.

"Is that so?" Elsa asked, sounding vaguely interested.

Anna watched out the corner of her eye as Elsa considered Saul with head tilted to one side, suddenly dangerously calm, lazy, almost, with her eyes half-lidded. All of her previous rage had simply vanished. Something about her demeanor eerily reminded Anna of someone, though she could not place who right that instant. Finally, Elsa leaned fully against her throne. With a light wave of her hand, she dismissed the other princes. But strangely, Alek bent his knees in a half-formed motion as though to turn and leave, and then stopped again with an unsteady wobble. Alek remained motionless while the others filed past him, ignoring their stares.

Once the four of them were alone, Elsa said, "What do you have to say for yourself, Alek?"

Alek pitched forward with a grunt, and only now did Anna see the half-circles of ice spiking out of the floor, no doubt having been manacled around the base of his boots. Catching himself on the tips of his fingers, Alek only barely avoided sprawling onto the floor. Saul repositioned himself to the side and stared down, the tiniest hints of a smile at the edge of his lips.

"Wait! Why are you asking Alek?" Anna said. "What about Saul?"

"Saul has already reported to me," Elsa answered, turning to Anna with a flat stare. "We only staged this to help you save face, Anna."

"Nice one, Saul," Alek muttered, straightening and looking upwards at Elsa.

"Save face?" Anna stepped closer to Elsa, but her expression never wavered from its blank mask. It was so unbearably cold that Anna stopped dead in her tracks. "What are you talking about?"

"What happened to Reid and Hans can be linked to Alek, and most importantly, you," Elsa said, but she was once again staring down at Alek and never looked Anna in the eye. "Saul is faultless here. Why did you ignore his directives?"

"He was locking me up!" Anna exclaimed.

"Evidently with good reason," Elsa retorted. She gripped the arm of her throne, as though fighting to keep looking ahead, but all at once she spun around and fixed Anna with a glare. "Look what happened. If you had stayed in the castle, you would never have been exposed to danger. You could have died!"

Unbelievable. Elsa was taking Saul's side. Elsa was agreeing with him about locking her up, as though that would have kept her safe. She was _in_ the castle when she first met the Sorcerer. It had been dangerous for her the moment Elsa left, no matter where she was, and locking her up helped nothing. But she kept silent. For whatever reason, she just didn't _want_ to tell Elsa anything.

"Fine, I was putting myself into danger. But what about demoting Alek?" Anna demanded. "It would have made things so much easier if we had the guards with us–"

"I have already explained that I hoped to aid Alek by doing so," Saul interrupted. "Moving with a troop of soldiers would have made it difficult to investigate, and knowing that Alek had less power would make the Sorcerer assured of his safety, more likely to leave behind evidence in his overconfidence."

"That is the biggest load of–"

"Please, Anna," Elsa said quietly. Anna swallowed her retort, unsure if she was angrier at Saul or at Elsa.

If Elsa noticed her displeasure, she said nothing about it. Instead, the queen looked directly at her and their eyes met. In that moment, and just that moment, something passed between them. It took place in the instant of a heartbeat, but during that instant Anna understood utterly and completely.

So _that_ was it.

And just like that, the moment passed. Anna pushed the thought away and looked off to the side, and Elsa turned her gaze downwards to the princes waiting below. Elsa continued, with such venom tainting her voice she sounded like an entirely different person, "So then, Alek. Report."

"With Saul here?" Alek asked.

"I trust Saul. Whatever you have discovered, Saul can know as well."

Anna clenched her jaw to keep from screaming.

Alek reported as Elsa had requested, starting from the beginning of her absence and recounting all the clues they had found: Alvard, the journal, the reports of the missing townspeople, asking around and finally discovering the hollowed basement in the unused warehouse. When he reached being separated from Anna because of the barrier of shadows, Alek stopped. And then Anna remembered – Alek had no idea about the reliquary or any of what had transpired between her and the Sorcerer.

"I think I should tell you the rest in private," Anna said.

"If you want," Elsa said. "And Saul, attend to Oliver."

Alek and Saul left the room, Saul taking a moment to bow before exiting. Anna cleared her throat when Elsa said nothing to her. Now that it was just her and Elsa, the silence felt unbearably more oppressive. It had only been three days. Why did things become so strained between them? Was she overthinking it? Was she the only one who found this situation tense?

"Will you not speak?" Elsa asked. She rose and took off her crown, placing it on the seat of her throne, and then she walked to the other end of the dais. With her back towards Anna, she looked up towards the chandelier, and the ice coating its surface shifted into blades and hardened.

"It's harder than it should be," Anna admitted.

"Have I frightened you?"

"No." Anna let out a heavy sigh and plopped onto the floor. "I'm just upset."

"So I have not frightened but upset you then," Elsa said. She turned around, and this time, her eyes were soft. She was the Elsa that Anna recognized at last, eyes not hardened and voice not caustic. It was like a storm had calmed. Anna was quietly pleased when Elsa walked closer and sat down next to her. "I was only concerned. When I knew you were in danger, only to be so far away…"

"I know," Anna said.

Elsa took her hand, and only when she observed closely did Anna herself realize how battered she was. Her skin was rubbed red and raw from the cold, and her hands doubly so from straining to lift away the rubble entrapping Hans. Now that the last of her adrenaline had run its course, it was replaced by the pain of her bruises, the aches of her bones, the soreness of her muscles. Anna blinked when Elsa raised her hand and pressed a kiss to the back of her fingers.

"I'm sorry I wasn't here," Elsa murmured.

"You didn't have a choice."

"Then I'm sorry for my conduct." Elsa lowered Anna's hand, but she kept her head bowed while she rubbed slow circles into her skin. "I was too harsh with you, and I did not explain myself. When I was returning, I was attacked by Oliver. I was wary of Alek doing the same when we first reunited."

"You mean…"

"Any of them might be under spell, and even they wouldn't know it," Elsa said.

"But then, I might be too," Anna said. Elsa immediately looked up, but though she was alarmed she was not – as she put it – wary. Anna was glad for that, just a little. "I-I met the Sorcerer inside the castle. Not face to face, but I heard him in my head and then I blacked out, and I'm just worried that something might be wrong with me now–"

"Nothing is wrong with you," Elsa said firmly.

"Alek said that too after checking my eyes. " Anna took a deep breath. "But you said that it might not be obvious. It might only be after a while."

"And neither of us can know for sure, but wouldn't now be as good a time to strike as any? I have no defenses around you," Elsa said. "You possess a shard of my reliquary. Maybe it protected you. Maybe it was impossible for the Sorcerer to do anything more to you."

"But what if there _is_ something wrong?"

"Then I will make it right."

Anna laid her head against Elsa and closed her eyes. She had missed this. She felt safe with Elsa close by. No matter what she said, the past three days had been hell and the brave face she put on had been worn down with everything that had happened, until it was finally shattered by meeting the Sorcerer, by what happened to Hans. Elsa was here at last. Anna could feel the comforting cold against her skin, not like the harsh winter outside but only the light breeze that was Elsa. She could feel the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed–

But there was no heartbeat.

"The Sorcerer made a reliquary too," Anna said, and she felt Elsa tense. "Markus made him do it when he was still just a kid, so that you could do it too but do it right. He told me that he was your prototype. He told me that his heart is crumbling away."

"He was lying," Elsa said. "Markus would never do that."

"But–"

Elsa pulled away from Anna and held her shoulders, eyes narrowing just a fraction. "Markus researched the reliquary as a way to protect the Southern Isles, but he discarded the idea as dangerous, long before he ever found me. The Sorcerer was lying."

"Just think about it," Anna urged. "You ended up making one. If he thought it was so dangerous, why did he ever teach you how?"

"Markus never wanted me to sacrifice my heart. I made that choice myself," Elsa retorted. "I ignored his warnings, and now I don't know who I am, I don't know how to feel–"

"You're hurting me," Anna whispered.

Elsa was gripping her shoulders so tightly that Anna felt shocks of pain jolt through her already bruised skin. And the cold aura that Elsa always projected had spiraled outwards, stronger, so that the cool breeze became a frigid chill. For the first time, Elsa had lost control around Anna. She let go the instant Anna said something, but for the first time, she had unconsciously hurt her.

"I'm sorry," Elsa said quickly.

"It's fine. I'm fine," Anna said.

Elsa tilted her head again and it struck Anna why the habit reminded her so much of someone. It was the Sorcerer. When they had spoken, he had also considered her the same way. And, Anna thought with a trickle of horror, Elsa had much the same mannerisms. Just like the Sorcerer, Elsa had shown bursts of rage and then sudden calm, switching between the two extremes as easily as someone might change masks. Even their desires to find themselves, the search for identity, all of it horribly alike–

"Let's get some rest," Elsa said. "It's been a long day."

"It has been," Anna answered. "It really has."

Anna followed behind Elsa, but despite herself, she felt the phantom pain of that tight grip around her shoulders every step of the way.

* * *

_Elsa is not the only one. We are both heartless._

Anna jolted up in bed, clutching the sheets with a death-grip as cold sweat ran down the side of her face. She doubled over, and then clapped a hand to her mouth to keep from vomiting. She felt feverish, body weighted down and joints sore and aching. With far greater effort than should have been needed, Anna wiped away the sweat on her forehead. Just the motion alone was difficult, like the air actively pushed against her hand as she moved. Taking several deep breaths to try to calm herself, Anna looked around.

It was still night out. At her side, Elsa slept peacefully, or as peacefully as she ever slept, her face void of emotion and her body completely still as her breathing ceased. It took conscious effort for her to breathe; Elsa only did it for her sake, to make her more comfortable. Otherwise, Elsa didn't need to any longer. Even sleep was a bare necessity. Anna knew she used to only close her eyes for a few minutes a night to recharge, and that was the extent of her sleep.

Watching Elsa sleep, so reminiscent of a corpse, only reminded Anna again that Elsa was not whole.

"What am I thinking?" Anna groaned.

_You are comparing the two of us. You think we are alike, because we are two of a kind, and what you are seeing now is only the truth._

It was _his_ voice again. Anna would have screamed if she were able, but her head snapped back from the force of her jaw locking against her will. She couldn't even turn to look at Elsa. She could only look out the corner of her eye but Elsa was still fast asleep, unaware of what was occurring. A dull laugh cut through her thoughts and echoed, as though her mind was an empty chamber.

_Do not deny it, Anna. Denial is what made Elsa and I what we are. Use us both as an example. Do not ever deny fact. Elsa and I are the same._

Anna couldn't say it. She could only think in her mind, again and again, that the Sorcerer was wrong, that she wasn't denying anything, that Elsa was nothing like him. But the thought had been planted. For every way that Anna could think of how Elsa was different, she could think of a similarity between them. She had these thoughts even before, but now, trapped and with the insidious voice of the Sorcerer whispering in her ear, they were all she could think of.

_Elsa is just like–_

Elsa was just like him.

"Anna! Wake up!"

Anna jolted up in bed, clutching the sheet with a death-grip, but this time she looked to the side, chest heaving with desperate breaths, and saw Elsa watching her with concern. Elsa reached out to her. Anna jerked away. She found her voice this time and screamed. She dragged the blankets up like a barrier between them, and as she continued to take in deep gulps of air, Anna realized what she had just done. She looked down as Elsa slowly retracted her hand, eyes hardening.

"I'm sorry," Anna said. "I'm so sorry, I was just scared–"

"Get some sleep," Elsa said.

Anna widened her eyes. What had she just said to Elsa? It was stupid. It was the one thing that Elsa would never want to hear from her.

"I didn't mean it like that! I wasn't scared of you–"

"I understand. It was just a dream. Goodnight, Anna."

It was obvious that she did not understand. Anna was suddenly reminded of the Elsa she had first met months ago, when she had first arrived at the Southern Isles and Elsa still hid and distanced herself behind a veneer of politeness. But no, worse. Elsa had only been distant then. It was the flat tone she used now, words carrying nothing behind them. It was a dead voice.

Anna felt her mouth dry when Elsa lied down in bed again with her back towards her.

* * *

When Anna woke the next day, Elsa was gone.

She wasn't surprised. If their roles had been reversed, Anna wouldn't have wanted to see herself either. Part of her was relieved, too, that she could avoid the fallout of that disastrous conversation, but the other half wished desperately that Elsa had stayed so that she could apologize properly. Elsa had left a short note on her spot in bed, telling her that she had to deal with the aftermath of the destruction left in the Sorcerer's wake. Anna considered going to visit Elsa in her office as she so often did, so easily, but that had been before. It was different now.

She stayed.

Anna rose from bed, feeling the beginnings of a headache. Not strong, but there was an undeniable pounding at her temple. Her shirt was plastered to her back by sweat, and her hair, far from its usual frizzy, tangled mess like most mornings, was stuck to her cheeks and forehead. Anna lumbered to the bathroom and splattered water onto her face, looking up from the washbasin to stare at her reflection in the mirror. She felt better. Not great, but definitely better.

Outfitted in one of her normal, everyday dresses, Anna missed the dress of ice that Elsa had made for her. She had been forced to switch out of it after being doused in wine by Reid, but she had missed it dearly from the moment she had lost it. Not because of its protection, though Anna supposed it would have helped with being exposed to the cold winter air. It was a gift from Elsa. It was the proof that she could relearn control, and by extension, relearn emotion.

It would have been assuring to see it one more time.

Anna wasn't brave enough to ask Elsa for another.

Considering that Elsa was currently hard at work, Anna figured that now would be a bad time to bother her, even to apologize for last night. Anna instead wandered aimlessly around the castle for a time. She raided the pantries and ate breakfast by herself, listlessly passing the time, before she realized that Edmund had wanted to speak to her. She could visit him now. It felt like so long since they had talked that Edmund, who had been her closest friend here in the Southern Isles, seemed like a stranger. It was only two days, but far too much suspicion stood between them.

Anna groaned and hid her face in her hands. All of her relationships were falling to pieces.

But she could still visit Alek.

Strange that he had not come to find her, actually. Knowing Alek, he should have been barging into her life with some awkwardly phrased question about her health and safety, violating more than one code of social conduct in the process. Where had he gone? Come to think of it, she had no idea what was decided for him after Elsa had dismissed him.

Anna left the kitchens and made her way to the princes' wing. It was a rare occasion that none of the princes were in the lounge area, but today the halls were completely empty. Maybe because of what had happened. Anna walked down the familiar corridor with thirteen rooms spaced out, eerily quiet today, until she arrived at the ninth. At the sight of it, she gasped aloud.

The door to Alek's room had been affixed with a giant metal gate, locked and bolted by several layers of strange wheeled contraptions. Anna couldn't even begin to make heads or tails of it. She approached it carefully and knocked, hearing the metal rattle but unsure if it would even get through to the other side.

"…Who is it?"

Anna could have slumped to the floor in relief when she heard Alek. "H-Hey! It's me, Anna. You know, your friend who didn't mean to get you locked up?"

"At least you learned how to knock," Alek said, and Anna could just barely hear him snort. She wondered if he purposefully did it louder so she _could_ hear.

"So, uhh, how are you?" Anna winced the moment the question left her mouth.

"As you can see, I'm under house arrest." Alek banged on the metal gate from his end and laughed too loudly, cheer sounding horribly forced. Alek never was very good at acting. "So I have definitely had better days. Should've taught you how to pick locks while I had the chance."

"I don't think this one can be picked," Anna said, eyeing the ugly gate closely.

"I was kidding. I hope you weren't actually considering it."

Anna looked away, fighting the urge to clear her throat. "Of course not."

Alek was silent for a time, and Anna wondered if he had maybe fallen asleep or given up at talking to her. Now probably wasn't the best time. She had chafed at the idea of being locked up when Saul had given the decree, and she could imagine the likeminded prince going insane being cooped up in his room. Did Alek need space, or did he need companionship? Nothing was easy.

"Hey," Alek said suddenly. "Have you checked up on Hans?"

"…No," Anna said.

She had never even considered the possibility. Not because she didn't care. On the contrary, she cared too much. It would be easy to shift the blame to the Sorcerer, but Anna also knew that if not for her carelessness, Hans would never have been injured so badly. If she visited and he was still in the throes of pain, what could she do? Or if she visited and he was finally conscious, what could she say?

"I get it," Alek said. "It's easy for me to think about visiting him. I'm trapped here, I couldn't actually go no matter how much I wanted to. I don't actually have to face him. But you…"

"I will," Anna said. "I'll go right after."

"…That's good."

"So! Why exactly are you behind this thing?" Anna rapped her knuckles against the gate. "Seems like overkill for little old you. No offense, but you're not really that dangerous. What are you going to do, smash your thick head against this and bust your way out?"

"Wow, thank you for that."

"My jokes cheered you up?"

"I was depressed before," Alek said. "I'm suicidal now."

Anna choked on air, but Alek laughed and she heard three quick taps on the other end. She sincerely hoped that he was _not_ actually banging his head against the gate, but knowing him, anything was possible. She would honestly not be surprised to see his head poke through the metal any moment now. Impressed, definitely, but not surprised.

"Pretty sure that Elsa thinks I'm with the Sorcerer," Alek said.

"Wait, what?" Anna narrowed her eyes. She had to have misheard.

"Makes sense when you think about it. I led you to him," Alek said, and Anna could practically hear the shrug in his voice. "Bad move on my part."

"And that's why you're trapped in there?"

"We screwed up. Whoever the Sorcerer is, he must be laughing at us right now," Alek sighed. "Not to mention whether Saul is consciously helping him or not, the Sorcerer must have done _something_ to him. And Elsa trusts him over me right now. Not good."

Maybe over _her_ too, Anna thought.

"Go to Hans," Alek said. "You don't have to worry about me."

"All right. Try not to go crazy."

Anna tapped on the gate and Alek tapped back on the other end, and she set off down the hallway once more. Alek was ninth and Hans was thirteenth, so despite the generous spacing between rooms, theirs were relatively close together. In no time at all, Anna had arrived. Summoning up her courage, she knocked on the door. Thirty seconds passed without answer. Anna knocked again and waited another thirty seconds. She knocked a third time.

"It's Anna. A-Are you awake?"

She pressed her ear to the door just in time to hear a loud crash from within, followed by a pained groan. Forgetting about manners, Anna burst into the room. Hans was sprawled on all fours against the floor at the far end of the room, his blankets strewn all around him, and Anna could guess that he must have fallen from bed. Far from his usual immaculate appearance, Hans had allowed his hair to hang over his forehead. His eyes were rimmed with black circles, and his skin had taken on a sickly pale pallor that reminded Anna uncomfortably of the late Tobias.

To her horror, Hans tried to push himself up on his arms and once again collapsed to the floor.

She realized that he could no longer walk.

"Hans!" Anna rushed over to help, pulling Hans' arm over her shoulder and half-lifting, half-balancing his weight, she successfully moved him back into bed. "A-Are you all right? Do you need–? Should I–?"

"Fine!" Hans said, tearing away from Anna as though her touch burned. Anna swallowed and stepped back, and Hans said again, softer, "I'm fine."

"Okay," Anna murmured. "I-I'm glad."

Hans ran a hand through his hair and dragged it back, but despite his efforts his bangs fell just a moment after. "Why are you here?"

"I wanted to apologize. I'm so, so sorry–"

"I told you already that it was my choice. You have nothing to be sorry for," Hans said. Releasing a dry, bitter laugh, he patted his legs. "I feel sorry enough for myself already, so please don't feel sorry for me."

"I-Is there no chance that your legs might…?"

"None. It was too much pressure, for too long. But I get to keep them at least. If Alek had his way, I might be even more of a freak than I am now."

"Alek was only worried about you too," Anna said.

Hans clenched his jaw, a muscle twitching in the side of his face. "Down there in that place, I attacked him. Why is he worried about me?"

"Because you're brothers."

"Brothers," Hans repeated, spitting the word out like something dirty, eyes coming to life with a flare of the old hate that he hid so masterfully. But the next moment, his eyes dimmed. "If we weren't born to this wretched family, Alek and I might have been…close."

"It's not too late."

Hans scoffed and spread his arms wide. "Look at me, Anna. It's too late for anything. There is nothing left for me but to sit here and atrophy like useless baggage."

"It's not the end of the world," Anna said, but she regretted the weak assurance immediately. She sounded patronizing even to herself. Desperate to correct herself, she elaborated, "You can move around with a wheelchair, or use crutches, and once you get used to it–"

"Why did you save me?" Hans asked, staring straight ahead at the wall, and Anna had no answer for him. "Well? Now you know what I did. I talked Alvard into trying to kill Elsa, and I talked Tobias into luring you to the tower. Or, more accurately," Hans said, barking out another short laugh, "I thought I did. But I was being played all along. I was just a _proxy_ to that _monster_, and I was deluded enough to think that I was avenging my mother?"

"Hans…"

"And now look at me!" Hans clutched at his crippled legs, tightly enough that it should have hurt. But of course he could feel nothing. It only angered him more that he could not. "I'm worthless; I might as well be dead. Worse than dead! At least a rotting corpse would feed the insects, but look at me. I'm just sitting here uselessly _waiting_ to die. Just sitting here like a goddamn _vegetable_, and everything I thought I accomplished was a lie!"

Anna stood there in silence as Hans breathed rapid, shallow breaths that did nothing to calm him, and she could think of nothing to say that would ever be enough to console him. She pitied him, though she knew that was the last thing he would want. Hans had been tall and proud, full of ambition. Seeing him now, crippled and broken, lost, made her want to rage at the unfairness of the world. It really should have been her lying there, not Hans.

"…It's not your fault. And I should thank you," Hans muttered. "Out of all the things I've done, saving you might be the one thing my mother _would_ be proud of. But I need to be alone right now, Anna."

"I understand," Anna said.

She backed out of the room and shut the door behind her, pretending that she didn't see Hans staring out the window into a world he could no longer venture.
