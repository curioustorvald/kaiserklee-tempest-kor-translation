**Chapter 22: (Ab)normal Days**

"Did you say you have a lead?"

Anna bit her lip and fought back the urge to tap her foot as Alek withdrew Alvard's journal from his coat. It was obvious he must have spent long hours meticulously searching through its contents, familiar enough as he was to flip it open to the exact page and hand it to her. She read through it quickly. October 7th and some description about the mundane morning, followed by a recount of a very ordinary patrol out in the castle town, all scribed in the same cramped cursive handwriting.

"I don't see anything special about this," Anna said.

"Look at the handwriting," Alek urged.

Anna eyed it closely, but everything on that page was uniform. She even flipped to the next page to compare, but the handwriting was exactly the same. She looked back up at Alek. "Still a bit lost. You want to just tell me?"

"It's forged," Alek said, and when Anna looked at him skeptically he leaned over to point at the individual letters. "It does look like Alvard wrote it, I almost missed it too. You're right that the handwriting is the exactly like his, but just a bit _too_ exact. Look at the t's on the other pages."

Bemused, Anna did as he said. Now that she knew what to look for, she noticed that, very, very rarely, Alvard would switch the way he crossed his t. Most the time it was a standard bar, but now and then he would write it with both ends curved. Anna flipped back to October 7th. All the t's were standard bars.

"Alvard never stuck to one way," Alek said. "Whoever was imitating him forgot to copy his flaws."

"But it could be a coincidence," Anna said.

"One thing might be a coincidence, but two and it's not just a coincidence anymore." Alek flipped the page, and then another, but he kept his thumb in between so that the backs were exposed. "Look, the pressure is different."

Alek was right. On the second page, the pen had gone further into the paper, so much so that the shape of each letter made indents. On the first…

"It's so much lighter," Anna gasped. It had been subtle before, but now it looked more and more as though the words had simply appeared on the page rather than been written. Looking at the page from the back, there were only the tiniest of marks to show there was anything on the front at all.

"I'm guessing this page was replaced with magic," Alek said.

"Something must have happened this day!" Anna rolled from the soles of her feet to her toes, back and forth, trying to think. "I wasn't here yet, right? Still a few days before then. Maybe we should ask around and see what the others know. What about Edmund–"

"We're not asking Edmund anything," Alek said sharply.

Anna paused. "But we told him everything. I thought you wanted him to help–"

"I just wanted to see his reaction," Alek sighed. "Don't you think he was acting funny?"

"You…don't think…Edmund…?"

Anna didn't want to believe it, but she didn't even know what this _it_ was that she was so afraid of being true. But now that Alek mentioned it, the more she wondered. Edmund hadjust run off after Anna told him about the Sorcerer. And he had been uncharacteristically frightened, quieter than he ever was, and not very much like the Edmund she knew at all. But it was still _Edmund_…

"I don't know anything for sure. I tried following him afterwards, but I lost him after a while. Just vanished, like a ghost," Alek said. When Anna said nothing, Alek rubbed his eyes, the scowl on his face deepening just a hint. "I'm not accusing him. Just…we should be careful."

"A-All right," Anna said. "We'll just look for the Sorcerer. Without guessing who he is just yet. After we find him, then we'll know. Right?"

Slowly, Alek nodded. "Yeah. That sounds fine. We can do that."

"Are you…all right?" Anna asked.

"Fine," Alek said again. Just as Anna debated whether or not to push, he thumbed a strand of her wet hair and frowned. "We should get you cleaned up. Forget me, _you_ don't seem all right."

"Y-Yeah." Actually, her head was beginning to spin, until the room moved about of its own volition. Now that the excitement was wearing off – replaced by the dull dread sinking to the base of her stomach like a hot ball of lead burning through her innards – the alcohol was kicking in. Anna shook her head. "I'll be fine in a little bit. Just…give me a minute. Please."

Alek escorted her to her room, the both of them silent the entire way.

* * *

Saul wondered about the exact nature of what stood before him. Shadows, but at the same time they defied all laws of physics and acted nothing like shadows. They oscillated in a continuous wax and wane but somehow still had physical form, free yet constrained, and Saul's mind went into overdrive trying to determine how it was even possible. From the base of the spiraling staircase, Saul looked up to see the Sorcerer, the shadows that made up his cloak never static.

He couldn't help but compare the impossibility of it to the equally unbelievable feats he had witnessed from Elsa and the power of her ice. After all, this very staircase he stood on was crafted by her magic, perfect and eternal. How could such a thin layer of ice have the force to withstand so much weight? How could she breathe life to her thoughts with such ease?

But maybe another time.

"You wanted to see me?" Saul asked, trying to take the steps and finding his path impeded by the staircase itself. It would not admit him. Every time he moved up one, the entire staircase would shift itself down. The step he stood on melted into the ground to be replaced by a new one forming up above in a continuous loop, and he ended up where he started. If he moved faster, the process only sped up to match him.

Finally seeming to notice his trouble, the Sorcerer placed his hand over the railing. Like oozing slime, shadows spread over the staircase, hovering just above the ice to form a second, identical staircase. Saul tentatively set foot on the first step, half-expecting to fall through, but the shadows held. In fact, they held on to _him_. Tendrils of the stuff snaked up his feet until a quarter of his leg was no longer visible, and worse, the parts of his body that the shadows covered felt like they had been detached. Swallowing his disgust, Saul slowly made his way up.

At the top stood a wall of ice emblazoned with a snowflake insignia.

"Why are we here?" Saul asked.

"Do you know what lies on the other side of this door?" The Sorcerer extended a gloved hand to touch the ice, tracing the snowflake, but his hand clenched into a fist when he spat, "Besides _Markus_."

"You call him by name?" Saul asked.

"I already call him Father in public. When I have no need to bestow him that undeserved honor, I may as well use his name."

"You're admitting to being one of us?" Saul had suspected, of course, but he never expected such an easy confession. All the signs were there. It was just a matter of finding out who exactly the Sorcerer was, but he was confident he would deduce his identity sooner or later. And then the tables would turn. It was a dangerous game he played, but after so long of limiting himself, this excursion into risk was as thrilling as the most powerful drug. His mind raced with possibility. Every waking moment was a glorious rush of adrenaline.

The Sorcerer answered his question with a quiet chuckle. "I don't take you for a fool, Saul. I'm sure you already knew. There's no point in hiding it."

"And you still killed Alvard and Tobias without a thought," Saul said.

"You don't sound particularly sad to see them go."

Once, Saul would have denied it. Any decent man would have denied it in a heartbeat, as easily as breathing. It would have been the proper thing to do, the _right_ thing to do, to say that he grieved for his brothers. He might have even believed himself.

"No," Saul admitted. "They were hindrances. It _does_ make it difficult for me to trust you knowing that you killed the two people who conspired with you."

"Don't say that. I would never have come this far without them; I only regret that they had to die. It was necessary." With that, the Sorcerer stepped away from the door and turned to fully face Saul, the horrible visage of his mask boring into his mind. Suddenly the image of the crucifix glowed molten, as though the paint had been set aflame. "Justice comes at a cost."

"And how do I know I won't become a necessary sacrifice?"

"Isn't that part of the game? But you should know that only pawns are so easily sacrificed," said the Sorcerer. "What piece do you think yourself?"

"I know better than to think myself invaluable to you, or to trust you," Saul said. "We'll see who comes out on top in this game between us."

"I look forward to it." Another quiet chuckle from the Sorcerer, and that was the end of it. "But we have digressed. Now then, on the other side of this door…"

"Elsa's heart," Saul finished.

"And my salvation," said the Sorcerer. It was a matter he had brought up before. For whatever reason, Elsa's reliquary was of importance to him, beyond even the power it must grant, but Saul was in the dark about why. Only another mystery to be solved. "But even if I had the power to pass through this door, I could not take the reliquary by force. Time is running short."

"If you are so much weaker than Elsa," Saul said, "I find it difficult to rely on your word. How exactly are you going to deliver what you promised?"

"Shrewd. But you've come this far without asking questions, so why start now?" Saul opened his mouth to object. In that instant, his muscles seized and his jaw locked against his will, so powerfully his entire head snapped upwards. Even his breath hitched in his throat, but though he desperately needed air, he couldn't move a single inch. The Sorcerer cocked his head. "You are already mine."

A twitch of his finger, and the Sorcerer released Saul. Saul fell to one knee, but his shallow, rapid breaths came not from desperation for air but from panic. "When did you do this?" Saul hissed.

"There's nothing to worry about. Just as you don't trust me, I cannot trust you. Our only difference is that I will have insurance. You remember Tobias?"

Cursed. Just like Tobias. When had he done it…?

But there was no point in wondering.

"You don't need to remind me." Saul pushed himself to his feet, swallowing hard to calm himself. It was fine. It wasn't unexpected that he wouldn't be allowed free rein. All this meant was that he needed to be more careful. Make sure he was still useful. Buy himself more time. "I've done everything you asked."

"Everything, and more. You really think I don't know about Reid attacking Anna? Make sure that doesn't happen again." Saul clenched his jaw and looked away, but the Sorcerer only sounded amused. He didn't need to see behind the mask to know the man was smiling. "I see why Elsa doesn't trust you completely. Why else would she take Oliver? Collateral, and it weakens your authority. A test, but with insurance. Wonderfully played. You could learn from her."

It stung. After so many years Saul knew that Elsa would never trust anyone, never trust _him_, but to have this final, irrefutable proof of her scorn tore open a half-knitted gash wider than it had ever been. Not even his temporary control of the throne could salve that wound.

"You should worry for yourself," Saul said. "Desperation has made you careless. Already Alek is on your trail. And I suppose Anna, though I doubt she contributes much."

"I was told as much; I do have ears other than you," said the Sorcerer. As he spoke his form melded into the shadows, leaving his voice to rasp as though muffled by water. "Wait for my orders."

Saul stayed. Once any trace of the Sorcerer had vanished, he turned back to the door of ice. Anna had passed through here; Anna had been able to climb this staircase and open this door. Tentatively, Saul laid a hand over the snowflake symbol. Nothing happened. It would never admit him. Bitter disappointment erupted from his chest and he laughed and laughed, laughed as though he could laugh it all away. It only hurt more with each breath. Saul closed his eyes and laid his forehead against the ice.

If he tried hard enough, he could pretend it was Elsa.

* * *

"Everything is ready. All we need now is the signal from Your Majesty," Oliver said.

"Thank you," Elsa said.

Seated at the bow of her ship, one leg hanging off the edge and the other bent as a perch for her arm, Elsa looked up to the skies. Clouds hid the moon tonight, thick stormclouds that allowed neither moonlight nor starlight to pass. Fog obscured even the waters down below. It was a pity; Elsa would have liked to see the moon reflected on the river. But, she comforted herself, overall it was better for the campaign to have low visibility. Oliver had somehow calculated that the weather would be like this and planned accordingly.

"I was only doing my duty," Oliver said. After a moment he claimed a seat next to her, knees bent and legs tucked in underneath him. "But you _are_ welcome. I was happy to help."

"Do you think it foolish to do the harder thing?" Elsa asked.

Oliver shook his head. "It's admirable. You really have changed. More than you know. I don't think you realize it, but you aren't the way you were just a few months ago."

"And is change a good thing?"

"It depends. Even the same change can be good or bad depending on why. Do you believe that you're changing for the right reason, Your Majesty?" Oliver asked.

Easy for him to say.

"…Just call me Elsa again."

Elsa disembarked, taking a small leap off the bow to land on the miniature tundra she had created. All of her fleet was frozen at the beginning of the narrow river inlet leading to Weselton, and already her men had prepared themselves. Ships abandoned, sleighs and reindeer were positioned in a two-file line ready to charge at a moment's notice. Kristoff Bjorgman was hard at work, running back and forth to make sure all the unfamiliar harnesses were in place. Elsa walked towards him, curious about him being embroiled in what looked like an argument.

"Listen, a reindeer isn't a horse. You have to do things a little differently," Kristoff said, but his words were ignored by the soldiers commandeering a sleigh. Instead, he was pushed away by the haughty men and sent careening on the slippery ice.

Elsa braced him from behind.

"Thanks," Kristoff said, but when he turned around and saw who it was, his face paled. "Y-Your Majesty, I'm so sorry about crashing into you–"

"At ease," Elsa said. Kristoff looked no less unnerved, so Elsa tried again. "You are Anna's friend. I've heard a lot about you. I owe you thanks for taking care of her when I was unable to."

"Oh! It wasn't a problem. I mean, Anna is a handful but I was happy to look out for her." Kristoff cleared his throat. "Not that Anna is, you know, annoying or anything, I didn't mean _that_–"

"_At ease_," Elsa said again, but despite her wishes, her voice came out more forcefully than before and likely frightened Kristoff even more. She sighed, and then signaled to the soldiers who Kristoff had been speaking to before. "You will do everything Bjorgman suggests. Understood?"

After bearing through a hasty, nervous salute from the soldiers, Elsa motioned for Kristoff to follow. It was obvious that he was confused, but he asked no questions. Once she had brought him to the head of the sleigh formation, where the ice ended and the river began, Elsa closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Drawing up an image in her mind, Elsa let her power flow through to her fingertips. She waved her hand, pushing and pulling the tendril of cold that released itself from her fingers into the form she wanted. It was a delicate but quick process, starting from the legs at the base and then building up to the actual cart, simultaneously creating form and carving intricate markings, adding finishes.

It was only seconds before her sleigh was completed.

"Wow," Kristoff breathed. Without prompting, he bent down to examine the sleigh more closely, tapping his knuckles against the surface. Elsa cleared her throat. Once Kristoff realized what he was doing, he scrambled to his feet. "S-Sorry! I was, that was just, your sleigh is just incredible so I forgot–"

"It's fine that you want to be familiar with it. You'll be driving," Elsa said.

"What?" Kristoff shook his head. "Oh no. Something like this? I'm not worthy. Seriously, this is perfect, I would just make it look bad."

"Your reindeer is named Sven? I took the liberty of having him brought to us." Elsa turned, and just on time, the scruffy-looking reindeer was being led to them. Oliver had to fight to hold onto the reins when Sven caught sight of Kristoff and dashed the rest of the way, skidding to a stop next to him and bouncing from hind to forelegs in excitement.

Elsa settled herself in the sleigh as Oliver handed the reins to Kristoff with relief. It took little more negotiating for Kristoff to agree, and after harnessing Sven, he claimed the seat next to her.

"Stay here," Elsa told Oliver.

"I'll be waiting for the good news," Oliver said.

Elsa pushed her magic forward just as Kristoff moved the reins and Sven began to move, and with every inch they drove, the ice spread forward into the inlet. Sven pounded his way down the ice that always kept just ahead of him, freezing the river and smoothing it over into a perfect runway. Sleigh after sleigh followed, but instead of a thunderous march, any sound was muffled by the ice. They surged up the frozen river in a soundless wave, like ghosts on the wind, and Weselton was none the wiser.

Very soon, she could return to Anna.

* * *

Even after a hot shower and several doses of something Alek called a remedy but tasted like metal, Anna felt dizzy. At least her face and hair had been cleaned of wine so she didn't reek of alcohol, but her steps had been so unsteady that Alek prepared to leave without her. It took her grabbing onto him and threatening to vomit over his pristinely polished shoes before Alek grudgingly sat down and waited for the two hours it took Anna to recover.

"You don't really seem the type to be so vain," Anna remarked, glancing Alek over from his rolled-up sleeves and sloppy tie to the strangely fashionable boots.

"Shut it," Alek growled.

Anna threw her hands up in surrender. "All right! So where are we going? Since you're paranoid and we can't ask anyone anything."

"We have a date to look into, so we should figure out what happened that day. Like I said, Alvard was traditional. Even if he hated her, he would turn in daily reports to Elsa."

"We're going to her office?" Anna asked.

"There's a reason I waited for you. Other than the shoes," Alek said, clearing his throat quickly when Anna muffled a laugh behind her hand. "It's sealed so that none of us can get in, but you…"

"I can get in just fine," Anna finished. It was true she could always bypass Elsa's defenses for whatever reason. Of course, she joked with Elsa that maybe she just liked her enough. Maybe that _was_ it; Anna couldn't be sure that wasn't really the reason. How it became common knowledge was a mystery.

With Alek as a guide, the route through unfamiliar territory was easier than her previous attempt at escape, and it took only a few minutes before they arrived. As Alek said, Elsa had sealed her office behind a layer of ice that spanned not only the door but three meters of the wall. Touching it would likely be deadly. It was cold enough that it bled off faint wisps of smoke.

Alek shifted and hugged his arms close to his chest, rubbing up and down for warmth. "Now that we're here, I'm not sure you should really–"

Anna extended a hand and pressed on the ice. She barely felt anything. One moment the barrier was there, then the ice began to shrink and the next moment, it had vanished and left behind a perfectly normal door. Ignoring Alek, she twisted the doorknob and walked in as easily as she would any other door on any other day. Three steps in, she looked back and grinned at the rare sight of Alek speechless.

"I don't know where to look," Anna said, and Alek snapped out of his stupor to finally stride into the office, trying much too hard to avoid eye contact.

As Alek fiddled, Anna took a look around. It felt like forever since she had last been in here, but she was glad that, contrary to her expectation, Saul had not commandeered the office. It would have felt _wrong_ for him to be here, and not just because of his sudden bizarre behavior. Anna began to tiptoe to the sofa before remembering that this time she didn't need to worry about disrupting Elsa – though she generally would somehow anyway, sooner or later. Anna smiled at the thought and took her usual seat. Then she looked down and noticed the edge of a folder tucked underneath the white leather.

"What is this?" Anna mumbled. It was unlike Elsa to be messy. Was it her fault then? Probably. Anna carefully withdrew the file and thumbed through the papers. Disappearances in the town? All the pages were about various missing persons…

"Hey, I found it," Alek called. Anna looked over to see him bent over a cabinet, one Elsa had said admittedly contained nothing of worth. Alek pulled out a report written on some sort of official-looking paper and scanned it, eyebrows furrowing with time.

"What?" Anna said eventually, when Alek remained silent.

"It just says a patrol out in the castle town, and it lists the outer sector instead of a specific district. Something about unusual circumstances," Alek said. "It's not like Alvard to be so vague."

"We still know where to look at least. And here," Anna said, handing Alek her own find. "Do you think this might be related?"

"…All of these are pretty recent. And from the same sector," Alek muttered. "Why didn't Elsa do anything about this?"

"I-I might have misplaced these," Anna said, wincing at the heavy stare Alek fixed on her. "I'm sorry! I don't know how it happened."

"We don't even know if it was really you. Most of us come in and out making some report or another," Alek sighed. "But you'd think Elsa would be careful."

There _was_ one obvious person Anna could think of that Elsa might trust enough to let down her guard. She had brought him to this very office herself. She had reintroduced him to Elsa after learning they had been close once. She had tried her hardest to patch things up between them because she thought Elsa needed someone she could trust and that she _could_ trust him.

Edmund.

"Don't," Alek said, and the gruff baritone of his voice cut through Anna's thoughts. "I can tell when you're overthinking. Just let things happen as they happen. We're going to know for sure later, right?"

"R-Right." She had to take her own advice, Anna told herself. As they left Elsa's office, ice reformed behind them to block off the entrance once again.

"It's too late to be heading out," Alek said, nodding his head towards the windows. It was almost night, cloudy and moonless. In an hour, maybe two, there would be nothing but darkness. "We can search tomorrow. For now, try to get some rest."

But it was easy to give advice and harder to take it. It was impossible to just rest as she was now, agitated and uncertain. "Before I do that," Anna said, "I want you to show me where you lost Edmund."

"It won't put your mind at ease," Alek said.

"I know, but…I still want to go."

At Anna's behest, Alek led her down several corridors to the princes' wing of the castle, followed by several mind-boggling twists and turns and, after another round of bargaining, left her with one last word of warning. She stood at a dead end. Apparently Edmund had rounded this corner and by the time Alek could follow, there was nothing but a wall, uncovered by even a tapestry. Small wonder Alek had described Edmund's disappearance as being like a ghost. He would have needed to either turn invisible or pass through the stonework to stay hidden.

"Please let it be anyone but Edmund," Anna murmured.

She never expected an answer.

It was only the tiniest hint of sound at first, so faint Anna thought she imagined it. Only when the noise persisted like an eerie song did she inch forward, breath stopping in its track, and then she realized where exactly the sound was coming from. She pressed her ear against the wall, and listened. It was a familiar voice she heard, deep and oddly synthesized, like it was muffled through water. It was the same one she heard that day in the library. Suddenly her limbs seized. She could no longer breathe, not by choice or reaction but by force. Her lungs had simply ceased functioning. Anna might have reached to scrabble at her closed off throat if she had any control over her deadened limbs.

"Sleep now."

Anna blacked out.
