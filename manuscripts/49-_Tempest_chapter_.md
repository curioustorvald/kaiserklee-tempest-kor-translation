**Chapter 49: At the Heart of All Beauty**

Visible at the highest peak of the castle was a gruesome sight.

Markus had been strung up and hanged from the tower battlements.

Agdar averted his eyes from the ruined corpse of the fallen king, so brutalized that he could not fathom the depth of hate the deed must have required. His throat, shredded and flayed, was now little more than a flap of skin that did nothing to hide the muscle and bone beneath. Agdar touched his knuckle to his forehead in respect, though few of the world leaders beside him did the same. Planning their campaign, they had discussed ways to counteract Markus. Never in his wildest dreams had Agdar imagined Markus would meet his end with such indignity, yet here he was, prey to the cruel elements.

"Perhaps Elsa overthrew him."

"No," Agdar said, though none of the others looked particularly convinced. "She was too loyal, and regardless, she would not have done…this."

Still, he could not imagine who else would be able to overcome the mage. It did not bode well. If they had not come so far already, he might have retreated for the time being; but their army stood just outside the gates, and victory was so close now that it would have been a disservice to the brave men and women who followed him. After triumphing over the leaderless forces which had attacked Arendelle, their counterattack had been swift and decisive. Momentum was theirs, and morale was high.

They would never again have this chance.

"What do you recommend, Lord Agdar?"

"We press on!"

Horns rang, signaling the army to proceed, continuing their inexorable march towards battle. Just ahead was the castle, whose walls bore such an innumerable force of archers that their red-and-white blended into an unbroken image of fire. Stationed at the base stood an army even larger still, the pikemen at the front, swordsmen behind, the flash of steel blindingly bright as it glinted off the snow. It was a force larger than they had mustered, even with their combined resources. They were only an amalgamation of small kingdoms, long oppressed, while the Southern Isles had cannibalized off their resources.

It didn't matter now.

It was do or die.

Agdar led the charge, sword held high in defiance and a war-cry tearing from his lips, as his horse powered through the snowy plains. There was a rumble of iron-shod hooves behind him, clapping against the frozen ground; and the thunder-like rhythm of the galloping horses substituted for war drums, the clattering and clanging of harnesses adding to the cacophony. Before they could approach, a windstorm of arrows volleyed from the walls, skirling and sizzling with fire. Agdar hardened his heart against the screams echoing behind him, the tumultuous thuds as horse and rider collapsed, the nauseating stench of burning flesh. War was always swift and brutal.

Finally, the two armies met.

They crashed against one another like the tides of a sea at storm, like lightning striking the waves. His horse crushed bones, trampled soldiers underfoot, and every stroke of his sword killed or maimed. Blood dyed the snow red as the battle devolved into a cataclysm of steel. Within seconds, the world became chaos. Agdar parried spear, axe, and sword, hewing his way to the gates. All around him, the tide of battle ebbed and flowed, as his men mangled and gashed the serried ranks, carving and cleaving towards the center of the enemy army.

But the enemy was pushed back easily. Agdar could sense their reluctance, could see it in their ashen faces. There was no initiative in any of their defenses. Agdar pushed closer and closer to the gates, cutting through the ranks of terrified soldiers, and then –screams, from inside. Before he could react, the gates opened of their own accord.

Agdar watched open-mouthed as Prince Oliver thundered forth on horseback, yelling, "Hold the gate! Welcome, King Agdar of Arendelle!"

All around, the battlefield degenerated into further madness as some of the Southern Isles soldiers turned on their own, and arrows fell both outside and inside the gates. Upon the walls, soldiers fought their former comrades, abandoning their weapons and grappling as savage beasts. Bodies were flung like refuse over the wall, the shrill screams of the fallen piercingly loud – before they struck the ground, and were silenced. Before long the battlefield had been baptized in blood, emanating the bitter perfume of crushed corpses, their entrails spilt over the once pristine snow.

Agdar's forces redoubled their efforts at their fortune, and the battle resumed, the army surging into the castle grounds. Oliver rode out, cleaving through his countrymen without hesitation.

"Why are you doing this?" Agdar asked.

Oliver smiled sadly.

"Because this is my home."

Agdar knew nothing of him, save for reputation. It could have been a trick. It could have been a trap. But taking one look at his face, seeing the resolve there – no less steel than the spears that glinted like wicked hoar frost – Agdar trusted him.

Together they pressed on, Agdar and Oliver, fighting side by side and leading the charge into the castle. All across the courtyard were barriers of wood and stone, and behind the barricades, solders launched arrows and lances both. Agdar had his back turned when he heard the whistle of an arrow, and he spun around, too late – Oliver cut the arrow in half before it could reach his eye. They exchanged a brief nod and resumed their charge. Agdar ripped a shield from the stiff grasp of a corpse, not recognizing whether he had been friend or foe. War hammers crashed onto his upraised shield, releasing shrill screeches as jagged ends punctured the steel. With all his strength, releasing an enormous roar, Agdar pushed them all away and fought on. With Oliver he carved a swath through the courtyard, but they barely made a dent in the overwhelming numbers.

There was cannon fire now, and the blasts rang, hollow, in his ears, as the sulfurous smell of gunpowder mixed into the carnage. With each ear-splitting detonation snow was blasted apart, upturned, along with the dry earth hidden beneath, into filthy geysers that rained back down upon them all. It was all the worse because the snow had been so saturated with blood and oil already. Agdar tightened his grip on his sword, fearing it would slip out of his grime-ridden hands.

"We have the gate," Agdar said, coughing when smoke cloyed his lungs. "We're in perfect position to take the towers, perhaps two hours, and if we can man the castle walls–"

"No!"

Oliver was interrupted by an oncoming wave of spearmen. His horse reared back and he fell, tumbling into the snow, but he rolled back to his feet and was on the group at once. Perhaps they quailed at the sight of their prince, for he soon disarmed them, slicing through the pikes, and they fled.

"We have more than enough men, especially with your reinforcements," Agdar said, extending his hand for Oliver.

"It would take too long. All the soldiers have been ordered to stall, to hold the castle for as long as possible, and whatever the queen might be planning needs to be stopped immediately." Oliver clambered onto his horse, face grim. "We need to storm the castle, and we need to do it now."

"It's impossible," Agdar said.

"For the army," Oliver corrected, hefting his sword. "But we can charge through the ranks while the army serves as distraction. Your Majesty, I'm sorry, but we must do this. We have no time! You are the last hope that I dare to have. Perhaps, at the sight of you, she might still give pause, become vulnerable."

Elsa would not pause at the sight of him, Agdar thought, but instead become infuriated; but he saw the desperation in Oliver's face, and he did not question. Kicking to urge his horse to speed, Agdar thundered across the courtyard, his steed leaping across the fortifications and knocking aside any who dared to stand in their way. Agdar and Oliver cut at soldiers along the way, but only to protect the horse's legs, and they knocked aside any stray arrows, and soon they had crossed the fountain.

Now the main doors were in sight.

And they opened of their own accord.

An armored figure stepped out, toweringly tall in his pitch-black guise. His visor was lowered, covering his face and obscuring his eyes, and together with his armor revealed nothing of the person beneath. It may as well have been a creature born of steel. Upon his belt hung a collection of swords, three on each side, and in his hands he wielded a great claymore befitting his stature; Agdar could not imagine the sheer strength necessary to wield such a thing. Oliver gasped, and Agdar wondered if he recognized the knight – but he continued his charge, eyes narrowing when the knight stalked forward, unfazed by the charging warhorse.

An instant before they collided, the knight sidestepped. With one mighty swing, he drove the claymore deep into his steed, gashing through its flank and releasing a cascade of blood.

They were thrown off the saddle when the horse itself was flung back, nickering its death throes. Agdar slammed into the snow, tasting the brackish tang of blood on his tongue. Barely able to breathe, head swimming so furiously that he could not focus on any one thing, pure adrenaline kept him conscious.

Blinking past his blurring vision, Agdar saw the knight approach. He had discarded the claymore, instead now wielding a longsword. Oliver had fallen unconscious; Agdar struggled to his feet, threw up his sword to block, but the knight's strike crushed through his guard before he recovered. Without uttering any sound, the knight hammered away at him, relentless blows delivered with utmost precision. Agdar had never seen such swordsmanship. Forced to step back, again and again – and then the knight spun past a stab, cut the back of his hand, and Agdar dropped his sword.

Defeated.

Agdar doubled over when the knight drove a gauntleted fist into his stomach. It felt as though his organs would burst with that simple strike – Agdar choked out a mouthful of blood and spittle, and he offered no resistance when the knight seized his neck. Agdar felt himself lifted off the ground and then slammed back down, his bones splitting and splintering with the impact. It was the hiss of steel that alerted him. Just on the edge of his fading consciousness, he saw the point of a sword hovering over his chest. Standing over him, the knight lifted his sword, and prepared to drive it down.

Before he closed his own, Agdar saw green eyes stare back at him.

* * *

Elsa leapt off her ship and raced through the smoky chaos that was the Southern Isles.

Riots had broken out all throughout the kingdom and they were especially prominent here, the poorest sectors closest to the docks. It was carnage. Commoners fought against the soldiers, their long-time oppressors, leaving the streets strewn with rubble and corpses. Soldiers cleaved through the unarmed without restraint, shields pushing them down, armored boots crushing heads underfoot. But what the peasants lacked in equipment, they made up for in ingenuity and sheer numbers. Elsa witnessed the mob overcoming armed soldiers with paring knives, splitting axes, even the weight of their bodies.

Homes not yet sundered had been set aflame. What used to be a white sky had been polluted to carnal-black and brooding, filled with the crackling of sparks flitting through the wind. But perhaps the haze and heat of the flames and the rush of the moment numbed the people to what should have been obvious. Only Elsa saw the lesion that pierced the benighted sky. Through the jagged scar shined a hint of white light, light somehow worse than the gentle darkness.

She had to hurry.

Elsa stopped for nothing, pushing past the belligerent crowds too frenzied to even realize who she was, and felling the soldiers that blindly struck out. Snow rippled into ice beneath her feet, and she glided across the plains. Faster than could be followed. Faster than she had ever managed before. She could not remember ever being more in tune with her powers. Once, she would have needed either the utmost concentration, or the simple, reckless abandon that came with being around Anna. Only now could she so effortlessly, so consciously control her magic.

Even the tiniest shard of her heart had returned her to her former strength, and more. How foolish it seemed now, to believe the reliquary could ever grant her power! It had done nothing but momentarily tear down her inhibitions. But now…all her world had brightened in an explosion of colors. Especially here, where the winter was at its strongest, Elsa could sense the magic of the ice and the snow like an extension of her being. It was seeing sights others could not, hearing sounds others could not. Perhaps that was why…

She knew something was wrong.

Elsa knew the power of her eternal winter better than anyone. It had already been an enormous feat to put the entire kingdom under spell, but she had only been able to freeze the elements. What was happening here went far, far beyond her untrained efforts. It was a sentient cold, ravenous, and rasping with deathly hunger audible on the fell winds. It sought out heat, burrowed its way into whatever warmth it could find, and consumed it entirely. Not just the body but heart and soul, as the cold enshrined itself in the divine warmth that it so craved…and gorged until nothing was left.

Even Elsa was not entirely immune to the effect.

_Why are you doing this, Edmund?_

Elsa thought there was a response on the wind, but she could not be sure. Was Anna omniscient now? She hurried to the castle, each second magnifying the sounds of battle which had once been distant. Something she knew well, but unimportant for now. What interested her was the immediately visible sight of the uppermost spire jutting above the smoke, the source of the lesion of light. There was where she needed to head. As Elsa weaved her way through the ranks of soldiers and surged through the open gates, she paid no heed to the others. She had not come here for any noble reason. What concerned them did not concern her at all, until…

She saw Agdar lying defenseless, as the knight poised a blade over his throat.

Lightning sprang from her fingers, ripping across the battlefield in the blink of an eye. It struck the flat of the blade and tore the sword out of the knight's hand. Without even flinching from the shocks no doubt coursing up his arm, the knight drew another of the blades hanging at his waist, utterly bent on his prey; but by now, Elsa had crossed the distance between them, and the avalanche of snow she rode upon crashed into him. It should have been force enough to rent his armor and shatter his bones, and indeed the armor crumpled. Yet the knight stood tall even as the snow surged around him. Ice froze all around his body in jagged crystals, like the blossoming petals of a flower, rising higher and higher until the cocoon had reached the level of his neck.

Elsa widened her eyes when the knight punched through the ice prison, and his one free hand began prying away at the rest. Snapping off one crystal, freeing part of his torso, he managed to lunge forward. His gauntleted hand grasped for her even as his eyes burned with rage. But he could not overcome her magic with brute force. Finally, her avalanche swept the knight away and tossed him across the courtyard. His body struck the wall with an audible crunch of metal.

He did not get up again.

"Persistent," Elsa murmured.

"You…saved me."

Elsa looked down, seeing for the first time that Agdar was staring at her with amazement. She offered him a hand, and he snapped out of his trance. Gingerly taking her hand, he wobbled to his feet.

"Don't mistake me, I have little good will for you after you tried to kill me," Elsa said, but her voice carried no malice. "Still…I understand. For Anna's sake, I couldn't stand by and do nothing."

"But if you are here, then…" Agdar trailed off, and his gaze turned to the castle. "Who are we fighting?"

Elsa did not answer him. Instead, she strode over to the fallen knight and knelt down, hooking her fingers under his helm. She tore it off with one smooth motion, revealing the face beneath.

She had known there was something familiar about him.

Alek's eyes snapped open.

His arm swung for her head. It caught in the ice which arose between them, holding him in place, and with that translucent barrier between them, Elsa could observe his face.

"Edmund ruined you," Elsa murmured.

There was little left of the boy she had known. All of his defiance before, she had admired with grudging respect. What she saw now was only a primitive beast, snarling, with teeth bared, and green eyes resembling saurian slits, festering with reasonless hatred. Watching him as he struggled against his binds, she could think of only an injured animal.

Elsa pushed herself back as Alek tore his arm free, releasing a rage-fueled roar and drawing yet another sword. Agdar might have yelled some warning, but with what came next, it barely registered.

"Let Elsa come to me."

She was struck by such pressure that it became difficult to remain on her feet. Even breathing became next to impossible. It was like an invisible hand pressed on her spine, forcing her to bow, but Elsa focused all her power and pushed back. Still, her knees buckled. Just as she thought she might snap in half, the force relented, leaving only a vague sense of amusement. It was no victory on her part. It was not something she had taken, but rather, something she had been _granted_.

There were similar reactions across the battlefield. All the fighting had ceased, and most the soldiers were on the ground, clutching their heads to drive away that haunting voice. Alek had suddenly stilled and now stood motionless, eyes vacant as though he were nothing but a doll.

Agdar retched. His face was sickly pale, but he still bit out, "Th-That was…!"

"Anna," Elsa finished.

"It can't be," Agdar said, his head snapping in her direction, but he knew her voice as well as she did. Neither of them would fail to recognize it. "No, I won't believe that! Anna would not…Anna cannot–!"

"It's just her body, possessed by someone else," Elsa said.

There were a million questions that Agdar must have wanted to ask, and Elsa might have granted him that, because it was his _right_ to know. But both of them knew they had no time. Instead, their eyes met. Elsa wondered if Anna had ever told him about them, whether Anna had told him of the good, or of the bad, or perhaps of both. Both, Elsa decided. Yes, Anna would have told of him both.

"And this…person…wants you to meet them?" Agdar asked.

"Yes."

"Will you go?"

"Yes," Elsa said, never so sure of anything in her life. She almost laughed, really, that Agdar even needed to ask. "If you were able, you would go too. I promise you, I _will_ get Anna back."

At length, Agdar nodded.

"Then I will endeavor to control the situation here," Agdar said. Raising his hand in salute, placing his sword over his heart, he gave her a formal bow. It was all he could do now. His voice and composure broke when he added, quietly, "Please, Elsa. Bring her back."

Elsa departed.

Alek didn't try to stop her this time.

Most men had the sense to let her pass, seeing just who approached and blanching, letting their weapons fall and making way for the force of nature which bore down upon them. Some of them were brave enough, or stupid enough, to stand in her way, and these were cut down without mercy, without thought. Nothing could stand in her way. No barricade, no door, no man or woman could stop her now. She stormed into the castle which had once been her domain.

She knew all these halls and corridors, could traverse them blind, but this place had never been home. It had been a larger prison, the prison for her body, while her mind had been trapped behind different walls. Her own furious denial had always been the real cage. Elsa walked inside the castle once again now, free, and imbued with a driving sense of purpose. Once again she made the trip up to the balcony, where Anna had once confessed her love. Elsa continued on, circling around to where the tower stood.

It was not long ago when she had last been here.

Except then, she had ascended these steps to confront another foe. Compared to that time her heart pounded against her chest, but there was no dread building in her stomach, no anger, and no hurt. Despite the urgency she felt, there was no need to hurry. There was still some time. Taking deep breaths as she walked, her magic resonated with that of the crystal staircase. It reverberated with the notes of a wind chime, the song of ice overlaying her senses with a comforting touch she had not felt for years. She was calmer than she had ever been, as she walked up the familiar staircase this one last time.

Elsa pushed open the doors, and stepped into the open air at the top of the castle.

* * *

"It's good to see you again."

Hans had wheeled his way into the stables. He could hear the battle taking place elsewhere in the castle, and yet he found himself unable to find the effort to care, or to even care about not caring. Apathy was nothing to be admired, but he simply had his concentration elsewhere.

Sitron whinnied in greeting, and Hans realized he had not visited in quite some time. Not since his accident, actually, despite whatever promises he had made to Kristoff about doing so. Sitron trotted ahead and bent, gesturing with his head towards Hans' legs.

"It won't ever get better," Hans said.

Not for lack of trying. Even after Saul made it clear he would never again walk unassisted, Hans had spent many nights attempting to push past the limits of his body; forcing himself out of his wheelchair, propping himself up with crutches that Oliver fashioned for him. With crutches and painstaking practice, he managed a few steps. It had been a glorious moment. When the excitement of the moment swelled, he allowed himself to believe, and he let go of his crutches.

Hans had crumpled immediately.

Of course he had known he would fall. It was his own body, and he knew better than anyone that his legs were beyond repair, that they would never be able to bear his weight, but the cold proof had nearly broken him all over again.

"I'm sorry I haven't been to see you," Hans said, patting Sitron's neck while the horse stared balefully. "I suppose I was jealous. After all, you can still walk, and I am confined to this…thing."

A cannon shot bellowed through the castle grounds, almost enough to shake the stable. Perhaps one of the cannons had malfunctioned and exploded. Hans was sure they were not meant to be quite so loud. Sitron perked up at the noise, head turning to and fro in search of the disturbance, but he was well-trained enough not to bolt. Hans patted him again, murmuring words of comfort, but they did little to calm him. Instead, Sitron began pacing back and forth, tail swishing with every turn.

"Are you trying to tell me something?" Hans asked.

Sitron walked up and nudged his legs, then jerked his head toward the doors.

"I want to fight too, but I cannot walk anymore. I'm not the man I used to be, Sitron. I'm helpless now. If I go out there, I might die." Hans smiled when Sitron knelt down beside him, folding his legs underneath him so that he fell at just the right height. "Which is why I'm here to ask you to be my legs."

He was afraid. Of course he was afraid. Death would never be something that he welcomed again, not after coming so close, and really, what sane person didn't fear death? But that didn't mean he would let the fear cripple him. His body might be limited, but he refused to let his mind be caged too. Had he debated going to battle? Yes. Even up to this moment, he had tried to convince himself otherwise.

But then again, he had brought his sword with him.

Hans clambered up Sitron's back, and he had never felt so strong.

"Go."

Sword drawn in his right hand and reins held in his left, Hans sped towards the battlefield.

* * *

Elsa shielded her eyes from the blizzard.

Because the previous battle had cleaved the walls apart, the dome was missing and left the tower as little more than a vast circular platform. There was no shelter from the wind and the cold. Rimming the tower circumference was the smallest of balustrades, from which was hung the banners proclaiming the rule of the new queen; but they did little to stop the snowstorm. It howled across the skies, sweeping thick flurries of ice and snow into twisting, spiraling currents. Up here, there was nothing but white.

High above the rest of the world, all else became unimportant. Nothing could be seen of the kingdom below, save an unvaried map; and the sounds of battle were distant, muted. From the moment she walked through the doors, she may as well have stepped into another world. All her thoughts now were on the person for whom she had come. She could, for the first time, put all else aside. Nothing else mattered now. All that remained was the two of them.

And there she was.

Anna.

She stood at the other end of the tower circumference, looking out over the battlements, where the Mirror hovered and spun soundlessly. It did not reflect her own face – Elsa was the one upon its surface. Anna traced the lines of her face, hand brushing over the expanse of her cheek, fingers tracing the contour of her jaw. Elsa could only see her back from where she stood. Her hair had been bleached of color and was now white as snow, save for rare strands of red which resembled streaks of blood. There was a terrible beauty about her person, clad in shining armor and her cape flowing freely in the frigid winds. And when she _turned_…

"Hello, Elsa," Anna said, and her lips parted into a small smile.

It was a horrible thing. Anna had always been beautiful, but the absolute power she emanated now had twisted her beauty into a cruel majesty. She was an apparition bathed in light, her head held high with the regality of not just a queen but a conqueror too. Her alabaster skin, pale and flawless, had lost the warm blush that so often adorned her cheeks, and now glowed with an unearthly luminosity befitting a divine creature. She was at once beautifully fragile, and horribly strong, so that those who laid eyes upon her would yearn to protect her and yet throw themselves at her feet. But the greatest change was her eyes. They burned molten blue, shining with a feverish intensity that was the only betrayal of madness which lurked within.

"Edmund," Elsa greeted.

"…Ahh." Anna lost her smile for the briefest instant, but one look at her face and she breathed out a small laugh. Her perfect smile returned, not deranged but not quite sane. It was a passable imitation of what had been, before, and the sight pained Elsa. "I would really prefer that you call me Anna."

"What now?" Elsa asked.

If Anna noticed that she had not agreed to her request, she did not comment. Instead, she stepped forward. "I guess that depends on you. We could just sit and wait for the inevitable end. It should be soon. Or," Anna said, her voice trembling with excitement, "We could do battle."

"Or we could talk."

"Is that your grand plan, then, to get through to me, to somehow wake…Anna?" She shook her head, breathing out a throaty chuckle. "I should correct you now. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you are _already_ speaking to Anna. Anna has not been entirely banished from this body. _I_ am Anna."

"I know," Elsa said, and Anna cocked her head. "I admit that some portion of Anna remains. Twisted, maybe, but I can sense her there. Except…I don't mean to talk to Anna. I came here to talk to Edmund."

Anna stilled, and even her smile seemed petrified. For a moment she said nothing, until her features relaxed and her expression softened. She looked terribly, terribly hurt. "I don't want to talk about him. Please, Elsa. We are finally alone, just the two of us. We should focus on us."

"…In just a minute."

Before Anna could say anything more, Elsa crossed over to the edge of the platform. Anna turned ever so slightly to follow her movement. Bending over the balustrade, Elsa began gathering the long banner from which Markus was hung.

"What are you doing?" Anna asked.

Elsa pulled Markus' body up to the top of the tower and undid the banner looped around his torso. Pale and frozen, he looked much more reduced than he ever had in life. There was nothing to be done about the horrific damage inflicted on his throat. But his face was calm. With his eyes partly open and his mouth half-open, he looked only frozen in thought, peaceful as he had never been. Elsa lay him down at the edge and closed his eyes, then stepped back.

"Why?" Anna asked again, all the emotion stripped from her voice, while Elsa knelt and bowed, touching her forehead to the floor three times. "After everything that he did to you, still...?"

"But he raised me," Elsa said. She stood, and gestured from Anna to Markus. "Could you do the honors?"

"If you say so."

Anna waved her hand, and Markus' body erupted into black flames. It only took seconds for him to burn into ashes, and for the ashes to burn into dust, before finally even that was carried away by the wind.

"Are you satisfied?" Anna asked.

"Yes," Elsa said.

"What now?"

"Shouldn't you be the one telling me?" Elsa nodded towards the Mirror, which still rotated in place behind Anna and hummed with every revolution. "I still don't know what you plan to do with that."

"Oh!" Anna blinked, jerking back with such surprise that her hair fell out of place. She ducked her head and tucked the stray strand behind her ear again. "Sorry, I forgot to mention."

"It's all right."

"Well," Anna said, smiling again, "I bet you must have felt the cold already while you were coming here. Even the two of us are going to be caught up in this spell. Do you want to take a guess?"

"Not particularly."

Anna snorted as though she had said something particularly funny, and turned to where the Mirror hovered. Drawing the emitted light into her hand, she began writing letters in the air with her fingers. Despite the childish delight she seemed to find in her newfound sport, these were not the works of an amateur. Anna drew beautiful calligraphic characters with a skill betraying years of practice.

"What do you think is our purpose on this earth?" Anna asked.

"We don't have one," Elsa said.

"Almost. Nothingness," Anna said. "I fought against the idea for a very long time, I thought I could find some meaning. But, I failed. Only one constant existed, and that was pain. Every minute spent on this earth hurls us closer to our destruction, and the path is riddled with pain…I could not understand. Why were we subjected to the horror of purposeless existence? Knowing that truth, I became afraid, and I despaired, I raged. And I realized. Nothingness _is_ our purpose. It is the perfection that our world should strive towards. Morality has no meaning. Life has no meaning. Nothing has meaning. I accept that our fate is nothingness, and I am so _liberated_ now."

Elsa stayed silent when Anna bowed her head. Her hands fell to cup her face instead, and her entire body shook until the pieces of her armor rattled. It was only when she heard a strangled breath that Elsa realized Anna was _crying_, choking back sobs as she continued to speak.

"It was because of _you_ that I feel pain, suffering, joy. It was _you_ who taught me this lesson, and _you_ who enlightened me. Both of us have suffered…writhed in pain…!" Anna spun around, revealing the glowing eyes and flawless face shining with tears, but all the while she sobbed, her face split into a wide smile. "So I will share with you my newfound purpose, because I love you so much, Elsa. Isn't that what love means, to share in our pain? It is through suffering that we'll be able to understand our love."

"Edmund–"

"Through suffering, I have learned truth. Through truth, I am set free. Only by returning to nothingness can we achieve perfection! No more life, and no more death. No more struggle for purpose. I will freeze the _entire world_ and I will freeze _time_, I will end our pretense! All things will be in equilibrium as they were meant to be, perfect, eternal and untouched by the ravaging of time! And the two of us…will be together forever, bound, heart, mind, and soul. As we were always meant to be, Elsa."

Anna looked up to the sky with an expression of rapture, and gasped a breath of exultation.

"Edmund," Elsa said again.

Slowly, Anna looked down. She wiped away the tears frozen on her face.

"Please, Elsa. Stop calling me that," Anna said. "How long are you going to deny me? It hurts. It hurts that you can deny me. Do you not love me anymore? I thought that was why you came. Do you remember that you used to love me? Do you…still love me?"

She looked so much like Anna.

"Yes," Elsa admitted.

"…We could have that again."

Anna spoke differently now. Not the impassioned fervor from before, but a throaty, breathy quality Elsa had never heard in her voice before. She heard…desire. So wild and so _raw_ that it burned. Anna stalked closer and Elsa wanted to move away, but she was paralyzed. Her limbs were leaden when Anna approached, and she did nothing when a cold hand cupped her cheek.

"Haven't you come here because love urged you toward me? And I brought you here, because I love you too – I told you before that I could be your heart, and I _do_ hold your heart now…almost. We are so _close_ to becoming one, Elsa. You just need to abandon thought…drop your defenses…and let me take you completely. In your mind…you have already succumbed to me. You have already decided."

Anna leaned in and pressed her lips against hers.

It was sweet seduction to hear this temptation.

Elsa was defenseless and silent, this moment when words ran dry. Anna sighed in contentment through their kiss, and Elsa really _did_ want to give in. She would have wanted this, once. She would have wanted to be overtaken by Anna. But...she could not imagine the sweetness and warmth of the Anna she had known, not from this thing that tasted of ice and iron.

Elsa pushed her away, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.

"You misunderstand me," Elsa said, and all the humor vanished from Anna's face. "I love Anna, and not whatever monstrosity you have managed to twist her into."

"Who…do you keep talking to, instead of me?"

Anna sounded genuinely confused. Not just confused, but angry, _hurt_, and Elsa realized the truth. It was not any play meant to confuse her, not some ploy to manipulate her with the face of the woman she loved. Elsa finally realized, feeling dread plummet in her stomach, that this Anna was not an act.

"...Anna isn't just a shell against the pain. Is she, Edmund? She's what you are busily becoming. You really…?" Elsa shook her head, feeling ever more pity. "You really think you are Anna."

"I am," Anna said, and then again, loudly, "I am!"

"All those twisted ideas, then, Edmund–"

"You agreed with me."

"I agreed that we don't have any purpose…but because _purpose_ has never been something we needed." Elsa smiled when Anna widened her eyes furiously. "And you understand that. Only you desperately needed something to hold onto, and when you couldn't find one…you threw everything away."

"Even our heart can be discarded," Anna said. "It should be obvious. Our human condition is failure. Only by surrendering to the escape of oblivion are we free."

"No," Elsa said. "I refuse to surrender because there will _always_ be life. Take away the need for purpose, and even in the nothingness that you think remains, there will _still_ be life. Even if there is nothing to be found, there will still be the search. Maybe, knowing that the cage exists…knowing that there is no purpose…that is our freedom. And maybe, just maybe…we can find something for ourselves, because we will never need to be dictated by some purpose."

"Elsa…"

"And you were wrong about the heart," Elsa continued. "It's the wrong choice to discard the heart, to try and throw away your identity. Edmund. You can try to become Anna. I know I wanted the same…but both of us are going to fail just the same in that regard. And that…isn't such a bad thing."

Anna opened her mouth, soundlessly, and she closed it again without speaking.

"I'm going to save Anna. And I'm also going to save you, Edmund."

"Edmund is dead," Anna murmured, but the conviction she had once carried was gone. She might have still been trying to convince Elsa; but she spoke so softly that she might as well have been talking to herself only. "Edmund is dead and gone, because there is nothing worth keeping of him."

Elsa said nothing.

"It's too late anyhow," Anna said. When she smiled there was a spasm of something like resignation, or amusement, or both; and then she hardened her face, and the Mirror shined ever brighter. "Within me lies the embodiment of perfection…the heart of Elsa, the mind of Edmund…and the soul of Anna. What power do you have to stop this winter, to stop me?"

"I'm not leaving without Anna," Elsa said.

"No more words between us, then." Anna lifted her hand, and the Mirror floated away from the battle that would soon ensue. Her lips turned into the same smile, too wide, too full, the smile that was neither Anna nor Edmund, but both. "I'll finally set you free. Come on, Elsa. Let's share our love…our pain."

And so they began.
