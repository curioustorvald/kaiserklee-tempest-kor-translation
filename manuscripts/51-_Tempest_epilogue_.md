**Epilogue: Exeunt Omnes**

_Der er et yndigt land,_

_det står med brede bøge_

_nær salten østerstrand..._

Well, Hans thought, lucky that hymn was accurate now the winter had passed. Otherwise, looking out the window to a frozen wasteland, that bit about their kingdom's lovely land and spreading beaches would seem insane. Especially since he specifically requested the national anthem be sung over the _royal_ anthem. Either way, even an inaccurate hymn would have been preferable over the latter choice.

Having the choir sing about terror and death and war and victory would very likely cast an unfavorable light on his coronation.

What a strange thought.

Alek braced him as he walked down the length of the chapel, where at the end of the hall was the anointing throne he had once dreamt of possessing. Every arduous step brought him closer to the prize he had once so passionately desired. And yet, seeing the throne, knowing that he would soon be king, brought him no exhilaration, nor even the slightest joy. It was a simple duty. No one else could do this.

Hans sat upon the throne, and he found it uncomfortable. Which made sense, considering it was made of narwhal tusks and plated gold. He would need to be some sort of madman to ever find that comfortable. As soon as he was seated, the hymn quieted just enough for the ceremony to commence. Sceptre and orb was brought to him by a bishop, and these artifacts, Hans held while looking out to his audience. It was not strictly required of him to speak, but…

"Unhappy circumstances have brought us here," Hans said, seeing the faces of leaders and kings who had come here not to celebrate his ascension, but to avenge themselves on the Southern Isles. "I take on the burden of kingship with no pride for my predecessor, my father, Markus. I do not deny, and I do not condone, the travesties of his rule. My pledge to you all shall be thus: I will, to the best of my ability, make amends for the injustices inflicted upon your kingdoms. From here on out, there _will_ be change."

Hans looked not to any foreigner now, but his family, his siblings, so reduced now that so many of them had passed. Cyrus, Stefan, and Rafael sat in the front row; Alek stood at his right, and Oliver at his left. All of them silent, heads bowed and without pride; and this, Hans could not allow.

"However, that being said," Hans continued, calm voice belying just a hint of the iron of a monarch, "I will not let the madness of one man overshadow the noble history of my kingdom. I will not allow the Southern Isles to fall into ignominy. Reparations must be made, and there must be peace, but I also promise my own people that the glory of the Southern Isles will not be reduced, but strengthened."

Anointment had not been something he looked forward to, and while oil was rubbed into his scalp, Hans preoccupied himself by looking out at the sea of outraged faces. At least Agdar looked admiring. As for his brothers…Hans was glad to see the spirit reawaken in their eyes, and they looked to him, now, for direction. Hans glanced to his side and saw Alek standing tall, Oliver smiling. They would be needed too, all of them. No longer was he alone. No longer was he the boy who wanted the throne only to sate his need for vengeance. Soon the crown was laid upon his head, its weight almost unbearable.

_Vort gamle Danmark skal bestå,_

_så længe bøgen spejler_

_sin top i bølgen blå..._

Yes, Hans thought.

We will endure.

* * *

It really took too long for the ceremony to end.

"It was a daring move, and I daresay you have made enemies today," Agdar said, but the enforced stern of his face vanished when he broke into a smile. "But admirable, truly. I share your sentiment."

Once the other guests departed, Hans had taken off the heavy crown and immediately returned to his wheelchair. Instant relief on his back. Next time he saw him, he needed to thank Oliver for making it so comfortable. Maybe he could do something about the throne, too. Narwhal tusk was terrible.

"It was important I give my people reassurance," Hans said. "Rebuilding our lives will be a long process."

"If you ever need assistance, Arendelle will be your ally."

"Thank you."

Without anybody else there, the chapel became hauntingly quiet. Light from the candles flickered and cast waxing shadows over the bust of Archangel Michael and the Dragon. It almost seemed as though they would come alive at any second and burst into battle once more.

"How's Anna?" Hans asked.

She had not attended his coronation.

"Still the same."

It had only been three days since the war ended and everyone woke from dreamless sleep. Hans was not quite sure of the specifics of what had happened. Except for Elsa and Anna, Hans doubted anyone knew the entirety of the story. All he or anyone else could remember was the cold, and even now, some of that winter seemed to linger in their veins. Hans never felt completely warm, and every now and then, he would be assaulted by shuddering chills; but they were passing.

Anna had remained in her room for the past few days, recovering from the ordeal. Barely speaking, barely eating, barely having the strength to even move, Anna seemed a different person from the optimistic girl he had met. But when Hans had told her the news that he would soon be crowned king, she seemed excited enough. Anna had even managed a small smile, and Hans allowed himself to believe she would come.

Until he told her the coronation would be held at the chapel.

Her face blanched. Hans would never forget the breathless horror he saw in her eyes. Anna had lost her voice completely, and could only shake her head, gesturing with her hands for him to leave.

Hans had not pressed.

"Anna is more than welcome to stay until she recovers," Hans said. As soon as the words left his lips, he knew he was only clinging to hope. Anna was the first person to have faith in him. Of course he wanted her to stay, to be well. "At least, until she is well enough to travel."

"I'm not sure that would be wise," Agdar said, though he seemed to understand. Hans nodded when he clapped his shoulder. "But I admit…I don't know what else _would_ be wise. She hardly speaks to me."

"I wish I could help," Hans said. "I don't know how to begin to thank her, for…everything. I was a very different person until she came. All of us were."

"Not just you?"

"Elsa," Hans said, and Agdar smiled softly in agreement. "I realize there is little credit to my word at the moment, but I'd vouch for her. Believe me, I hated her just as much as anyone. More, even. But…I still trust that she means no harm to anyone, now. She _did_ save us all."

"Don't worry," Agdar said. "Whatever formality ends up being decided, I doubt anyone will be able to enforce punishment. Nor would they be willing to try. What do you think she'll do next?"

Hans smiled.

"Anything she wants, I suppose."

* * *

Elsa filled in his grave with her hands.

Edmund did not have the privilege of a royal burial, nor even the right to a complete corpse. There would be no tombstone, no epitaph. His body had been burned, and the ashes would have been left unattended to scatter into the wind; but Elsa had not allowed such indignity. She collected his ashes and brought the urn with her to the cemetery.

She felt compelled to do something for him. Perhaps because she was the only person to know who he really had been, and she knew his loneliness, his desperate search for security. Allowing him to be sent alone into the wind just felt wrong. Edmund would not have desired any sort of memorial, but to be cast away without direction, without home, that was a fear shared between them.

Elsa dug out the earth beside Gustaf's tomb, and placed Edmund's ashes there.

She filled in the grave without magic, choosing to use her hands. Only recently thawed, the soil was still dry, and rough enough to almost make her hands bleed, but she persisted. It was an amateurish effort, but she thought it felt more genuine. Using magic – the thing that had ruined his life – seemed an insult.

Finally, the deed was done.

Elsa stepped back, but she had not brought any offerings. She doubted he would want anything of hers, and the one thing he did want, she had fulfilled. Here, beside Gustaf, perhaps he would find home.

"Now you can be with him," Elsa said.

She struggled for words. She had never been one for such things, and Edmund had deemed her a poor conversationalist, let alone any kind of eulogist. Still, there was no one else here, and there never would be. Once she left, no one would ever come here again. Just this once, she would speak to him.

"Anna wanted to be here." But Elsa knew that was a lie, so she did not linger long on the subject. No one else had wanted to be here. It felt an awful irony that Edmund would hold funerals for all his brothers, and be denied one. "Although, I suppose you would prefer anyone over me."

Though, had she imagined the sense of solidarity between them? She had been the one he sent to Baaj, and he had been the one to teach her through his memories. They really were two of a kind. Elsa placed a hand over her heart, feeling the rhythmic pulse reassure her once more that she was no longer the twisted thing she had become.

"I remember when we fought the first time, and you told me that you were my senior," Elsa said. "In the end, you really did teach me, so I suppose…I should thank you for your instruction."

But he had told her never to thank him.

"You saved me," Elsa said.

She rose.

"I'm going to fulfill my promise. I'm going to find something for both of us."

And she wouldn't look back.

* * *

Elsa knocked on the door once, twice.

She knew that Anna was still awake, but she waited for the quiet answer before entering. It was already night outside, but in her room, the number of candles may as well have substituted for the sun. Anna preferred it that way. She sat in a wheelchair now, hands folded neatly in her lap. Situated near the window, she could look out toward the sea. Even from here, the gentle lapping of the waves on the shore was visible, washing onto land and being swept back into the sea without cease.

"Did the coronation go all right?" Anna asked.

She sounded different. No longer was she the excitable, energetic woman from before; Anna rarely spoke now. She only ever initiated conversation with Elsa. Sometimes she would be so lost in thought that she forgot to respond to others. Even when she did, she always spoke softly, voice raspy as though her vocal cords had atrophied from disuse, or that she only had partial control over them.

"I didn't go," Elsa said.

"Oh." Anna turned around, tilting her head, but she straightened again as quickly as she had made the motion. "What else were you doing?"

"Nothing important." Elsa walked closer and kneeled down next to Anna. "I didn't _miss_ anything important either. Hans being crowned king doesn't quite make my list of priorities."

Anna nodded.

She looked exhausted. Any strength she had, during those first moments after being freed of possession, had been born of adrenaline. Ever since then she had been drawn, and drained, beyond anything Elsa had ever seen or expected. Anna's face was sallow and sickly, eyes rimmed with black circles. She could not walk. Her hands shook. Too often, her gaze was unfocused, glassy; but the worst part was that she would momentarily snap back into attention with such horror that Elsa could only imagine what memories she had relived.

"Have you eaten?" Elsa asked.

"I'm not too hungry today."

Just as she hadn't been too hungry the other days, but Elsa didn't say anything. Instead she remained kneeling there with Anna, and placed her hand over the arm of the wheelchair as though she was balancing her weight. Anna noticed. Elsa saw her glance at her hand before looking down, but she did nothing. Elsa waited. After some time, Anna looked up again and, slowly, inched her hand toward hers.

"I'm here," Elsa murmured, opening her palm and intertwining their fingers.

"…I know."

Silence again, and Elsa closed her eyes. She concentrated on the soft sounds of Anna's breathing, thumb slowly rubbing circles into the back of her hand. Her skin wasn't cold, but not warm.

"You aren't asking me what's wrong," Anna said. "Everybody else does."

"I don't know how to ask without disregarding your feelings," Elsa said, opening her eyes to see Anna staring. Anna bowed her head as soon as she did, breathing quickening and falling out of its original rhythm, and Elsa added, "I'll wait until you want to tell me. I'll be here when you're ready."

Anna bit her lower lip, but her breathing had calmed somewhat.

"…I'm tired."

"Do you want to go to bed?"

"No," Anna said quickly, and her grip tightened so much that her knuckles whitened. Just for a moment until she forcibly relaxed. "I just – I want to stay here. I don't want to sleep yet. Can you stay with me?"

"Of course."

Elsa had spent the last few nights sitting outside the door in silent vigil. Not because anyone found it improper for them to share a room; Anna had wanted to be alone. Elsa waited outside just in case she was ever needed, so she knew that the candlelight was never extinguished. She doubted Anna had slept at all for the past nights. But she didn't push. It took every ounce of control that she possessed, but she did not push. She simply waited, because she knew she had to be there.

"I'm sorry I'm a burden."

"You're not," Elsa said. "And you never will be."

Anna did not respond, and Elsa waited again. Not silently, this time. She hummed a melody while they looked out to the sea. After several minutes, Anna's breathing calmed and slowed into a steady pace. Perhaps it was the rhythm of the waves, or the cadence of her melody, or even the gentle touch of her hand, but Elsa was surprised to see Anna closing her eyes. She slumped into the wheelchair as her head lolled faintly to the side. She was finally sleeping.

Asleep, Anna looked less tense. Lines that had been etched onto her face smoothened, and her lips, usually pursed shut, parted. Elsa reached out to brush away the hair that had fallen into her face, carefully, so she would not be noticed. Anna had begun leaving her hair unkempt. It hung down past her forehead and dipped into her eyes, but now, with her hair tucked back, she looked more herself. Elsa could allow herself to believe that Anna would heal.

Then Anna bolted upright.

"Anna–?"

Elsa jerked back when Anna lashed out, arms swinging with strength she had not shown for the past three days. It was a wild, ferocious movement. Anna thrashed soundlessly in her seat, punching, swinging; Elsa seized her flailing arms and moved to her front, hardly understanding what was happening. Was Anna having a nightmare? Was she trying to protect herself from something in her dreams? And then her eyes snapped open. Wide and with pupils dilated, glowing with feverish light.

It reminded Elsa of another time, and a trickle of horror bled into her mind.

But no, not that again. Anna's face contorted as she screamed, but she didn't even have enough air to sustain it long. Her breathing turned harsh and ragged, and sweat marred her forehead. Though her eyes were on Elsa, there wasn't an inkling of recognition. She wasn't looking at her at all. Elsa tried to keep a tight hold on her arms, afraid that Anna would hurt herself, but Anna yanked back and she had to let go. Anna curled in on herself, trembling, muttering unintelligible words under her breath.

Elsa couldn't handle it anymore.

"Anna!" Elsa yelled, and she shook her shoulders because she _needed_ Anna to wake up.

It was the wrong thing to do.

Anna screamed again, flinging Elsa back and jerking away so violently that her wheelchair toppled. Try as she might to scramble to her feet, Elsa was too slow to stop Anna from falling. She hit the floor on her side, hard, but she didn't even seem to notice. Whatever she was running from, whatever terrified her so much, drove her onward even despite her disability. Anna crawled away, fingers digging into the carpet as she scrabbled for purchase.

"Get away! Stop. Stop! Get away from me, I don't want – I don't want – _Get out!_"

Slowly, Elsa rose. Anna had not made it far, and the desperate strength that had borne her away seemed to have vanished. It left her crumpled, broken and sobbing desperate pleas to no one. She sounded so strangled that Elsa feared she wasn't breathing. Elsa approached her again, careful to keep herself in check. Anna needed her to be calm.

"It's me," Elsa murmured, but she didn't dare to touch Anna, not yet. "It's Elsa, I'm not – I'm not him. It's going to be okay. One day, you _are_ going to be okay, Anna."

She stooped and slid one arm under Anna's neck, and the other under her knees. Anna seemed to have subsided for now, and offered no resistance. Elsa lifted her up and carried her to bed, taking slow, measured steps that would not jostle her along the way. When Anna was finally in bed, Elsa sat down at her side, watching, feeling agony at the thought that she could do nothing. Anna was whimpering with fear and pain, and she could do nothing but watch.

"I'm sorry," Elsa said, brushing away her tears, feeling the feverish heat of her skin.

Just as she was pulling away, Anna reached out and caught her hand. She clutched on tightly, instinctively, as she would never allow herself to do anymore while awake. Anna had once again closed her eyes, but she was not resting. She still looked terrified. Elsa gently squeezed her hand, just so Anna would know that she was _there_. Some of the tension left her face. She still emanated heat from her entire body. Her face was still flushed red with pain. Her hair was still matted with sweat.

"Hot," Anna choked out.

Elsa lifted her hand, and pressed her bare skin against Anna's forehead.

Anna calmed and slept through the night.

* * *

"Is she…?"

"Asleep," Elsa said.

Agdar sagged with relief, sliding down against the wall and heaving a deep sigh. He had been outside as soon as she left the room. Elsa admired how he managed to keep poised the last few days, dealing with all the political entanglement, but knowing his daughter was suffering must have weighed on his mind. As soon as his work was done, he would come here, in the dead of night; and Elsa, waiting outside every night, would simply nod and wave him away. It would be a disservice to talk about Anna behind her back. Agdar only needed reassurance that she was…fine. Tonight, though, she could give him one word.

"She'll be all right," Agdar said, but Elsa had the feeling he was talking to himself. "I'll bring her home, and everything will be how it used to be."

"It's not that simple," Elsa said.

She remained standing while Agdar looked up to meet her gaze.

"It's not better for her to be cooped up here," Agdar said. "I'm going to bring her _home_, Elsa. Not this place where nothing but misfortune has befallen my daughter, who deserved none of this ordeal."

"But you think the four walls of her room in Arendelle are going to be better?"

Agdar clenched his fists, and Elsa wondered for a moment whether he would actually attack; but he had better control than that, no matter what enmity had existed between them.

"I am grateful that you saved Anna," Agdar said. "But I have not forgotten that you tore her from home."

"I did," Elsa said, nodding. "And I will do everything I can to be there for her now, even if that means pointing out your stupidity."

"Do you think you know better than me?"

"I do," Elsa said, and before Agdar could finish his protest, she added, "Because I'm not the one who only remembers the little girl who left Arendelle, not knowing anything about the world."

Agdar had been ready to rise to his feet, but hearing her words, every hint of fight disappeared from his face. She had never seen him so resigned, as he slumped and closed his eyes. Not when she conquered Arendelle, and not when she prepared to kill him for his treachery. Only now, when he realized that he knew nothing of how to help Anna, was he defeated.

"I know you love Anna, and Anna knows that too," Elsa said.

She _did_ feel sympathy for him. It was…an odd feeling, but when she put more thought into it, she realized it was not so strange. He was only trying his best, and in that part of him, she could see Anna.

"Does she, really?" Agdar clasped a hand over his face, rubbing his eyes so roughly that they had reddened when he pulled away. "I have been…powerless. I have done nothing, while she suffered."

"You cannot magically fix her problems."

"I wish I could."

"And how would you choose to do that?" Elsa asked. "She cannot be your preconceived notion of Anna. She cannot be under your wing all her life. She hasn't been for some time."

Agdar met her gaze again, and there was a curiosity in his eyes that she did not understand.

"…She told me something similar before," Agdar said.

"Then you should already know."

Elsa offered him a hand, and Agdar only stared. She twitched her fingers up when he did nothing, and seeming startled by the motion, he finally took her hand and rose to his feet. Clearing his throat and nodding, he wavered between speaking and not. Elsa waited. She might as well, considering how much effort she had already put into this.

"What will _you_ do, then?"

"I think…I'm going to leave," Elsa said, and Agdar did not look surprised. "I made someone a promise, and I cannot fulfill it here. I'm going to see the world with my own eyes."

Agdar scrutinized her face once again. Elsa stared back, reminded of that brief moment during the battle, when Agdar had asked, pleaded, for her to save Anna. It was the same look in his eyes now. Whatever he was looking for from her gaze, he seemed to find.

"Could you take Anna, too?" Agdar asked.

"Why do you think I'm bothering to tell you anything?" Elsa smiled, but she was not looking towards Agdar anymore. She glanced back, towards the door that led to Anna. "As long as she wants to."

At length, Agdar nodded.

"I will miss her every day, but…I trust you," Agdar said, laughing quietly. It was a small, pitiful sound. "I cannot believe I am admitting this, but I trust that you will be there for Anna."

Elsa nodded back.

"…Thank you for understanding."

* * *

Anna woke slowly, surprised to open her eyes to daylight.

She did not remember falling asleep, and the thought terrified her for a moment, that she did not remember moving to the bed; but when she saw Elsa seated at the corner of the bed, leaning against the bedpost with her eyes closed in sleep, she calmed. Anna swallowed, throat parched for no reason immediately apparent. Her muscles hurt, too, but along with their weakness was an ever-present ache, so she did not think much of that twinging pain. She felt stronger than before, anyhow.

"Elsa," Anna said quietly.

She woke immediately, blinking only twice before awareness returned and her gaze focused. Elsa smiled softly and, before Anna could try to say anything more, reached for the pitcher of water at her bedside. She poured out a glass, and Anna took it gratefully to soothe her throat.

"You fell asleep last night, and I didn't think the wheelchair would be too comfortable," Elsa said.

Elsa sat closer, taking her hands in her own, and Anna was torn. She needed to push her away. It would be for her own good. At the same time, she _wanted_ to be here, she _wanted_ to be close_._

"You do too much for me," Anna said.

"You deserve everything and more."

No, Anna wanted to say, because–

"Do you want something to eat?" Elsa asked.

"Oh." Anna had not felt hungry for the past three days – and she remembered that _he_ had never eaten even before that – but at the mention of food, she realized she _did_ want to eat. "Y-Yeah, just a little bit."

Elsa nodded, and after carefully setting her against the headboard, crossed to the other side of the room. Anna watched curiously, having expected that Elsa would help her into her wheelchair and bring her to the kitchens, but she was enormously grateful when she saw the covered plate sitting in a tray on her desk. Elsa brought it back and took off the dome to reveal light foods, soup and bread, suitable now that she was still unused to eating.

"It's good," Anna said, after taking a few sips of the clear broth, and she did feel considerably warmed. Despite the newly awakened sun and return of the comfortable heat characteristic of the Southern Isles, she had never felt completely warm. Not even now, but the food helped more than she expected.

"It's strange for me, too," Elsa said suddenly. "Needing to eat, and needing to sleep. Being so alive is a strange sensation, but then, I think I enjoy this too."

Of course, Anna realized, Elsa would have needed to adjust. Having her heart back, being completely human again. Anna was so happy, so proud of how far she had come, but – for some reason, she couldn't find the words to tell her that. Not anymore. At one point, she would probably have leapt into her arms and wrapped her into the tightest hug she could manage, but now – no, she couldn't do that.

"Have you eaten chocolate?" Anna asked.

"Not yet," Elsa said, smiling. "It's too heavy. I could manage to eat it before, you know, because my body was essentially…dead. But not anymore. I'll need to work my way up to chocolate."

"Sounds good."

Elsa nodded, and the silence that fell was beyond uncomfortable. Anna wanted to say something, and Elsa probably knew. She was waiting. Anna wished she would stop being so considerate. How did she always know? Anna would try to end conversations deliberately, hope she would be fed up and leave like she should, but Elsa would just wait. She had to know. She knew Anna still wanted her there.

She just didn't realize how selfish she was being.

"Have you thought about what you're going to do?" Anna asked.

"I might…travel." Elsa was watching her carefully as she spoke. Anna ducked her head and continued to eat, but it was only an excuse now to hide from her gaze. "I spent so much time being owned, manipulated. I want to see the world. I want to see how it really is."

Yes, that was how it should be.

Elsa deserved to be free.

"That's good," Anna said. She ate hurriedly, trying to control her increasingly shallow breaths, but her chest constricted, knowing Elsa really would leave. "Good. Yeah, really good." Was she happy, or not?

Both.

Yes, both.

"You have a little something…there." Elsa made a half-hearted gesture at her own mouth, before she smiled, shaking her head, and said, "Here, I'll get it."

Elsa picked up a napkin, and reached out to dab the corner of her mouth.

Anna flinched, so violently that the tray fell and crashed to the carpet, and Elsa immediately pulled back.

"It's not – I'm sorry," Anna said, looking away from Elsa. She couldn't bear to see the hurt that was no doubt on her face. Everything was her fault. "It's not you, I swear, I'm just, I just–"

"Anna."

She did not look hurt.

"It's okay," Elsa said, and she was so patient, so understanding, that her heart clenched.

She did not deserve this.

"It's not okay," Anna said, unable to keep her voice from harshening, because it was so _unfair_. "You've been doing so much for me, and I, I just – I keep forcing you to stay with me because I want to be with you, so, so much, but I can't even _stand_ to be around you sometimes, I keep thinking that I'm just going to hurt you – I _will_ hurt you, I already have."

They had avoided the subject for so long. Anna hadn't wanted to talk about it, because she wanted this, what they had, to last; and Elsa had let her stay silent for too long, longer than she deserved. Anna hadn't wanted her to realize how dangerous she was, and leave, because _that_ was the best thing for Elsa. Not to be stuck here taking care of her even after everything she had done.

"You would never hurt me," Elsa murmured.

And Anna laughed.

Because she still remembered doing exactly that. Hurting Elsa, plunging a knife into her back and feeling such visceral glee at the sight of her suffering that even the memory made her sick. She felt so powerful. She felt so secure, so comforted, being able to dominate Elsa. She, who was protected by her father for most of her life, and then thrust into an unfamiliar world. She, who was completely ordinary, and unable to defend herself from anything or anyone. She, whose fate had always been dictated by another person. Just that once she was the one holding the power over others, and she had _loved_ it.

"You still think it was all him," Anna said, and as much as she hated what she was saying, she was so relieved to finally just confess her own depravity. "I was there, Elsa. I knew what I was doing. I _wanted_ to have your heart all to myself because – I'm just like everyone else, I just want to _own_ you. It's sick. You need to get away from me before anything happens again. I'm not…I'm not good for you. Please."

She had finally laid it all out; Elsa was going to leave her now, and never look back. It was for the best. It was supposed to be that way. Anna bowed her head, feeling tears well behind her closed eyes when she heard movement. Elsa was leaving. Just as she should. She would be free now, free of her cage.

Instead, Elsa put her hands on her shoulders and shifted her up. Anna looked up to see her face inches from her own, no longer smiling, but instead meeting her eyes with a steel gaze.

"Listen to me," Elsa said, both firm and gentle at the same time, voice like iron but her touch soft. "I'm not under any delusion. I know you were there too. When we fought – I knew you were there."

"Then you should go, and travel like you want, leave me–"

"You were there, but that was _not_ you." Elsa moved her hands to cup her face, and Anna could feel her hands, her entire body trembling with emotion.

"How can you know?"

Because Anna certainly did not.

They had been so intertwined, the two of them. She hardly knew where her mind ended and _his_ began, where _his_ desires ended and her own started.

"Because I know you never wanted anything but the best for me," Elsa said.

"That's not true," Anna said quickly.

She wanted to be her heart.

It was always just her selfish need to be loved, to be needed.

"You were only misled about the best way to do that."

"Stop making excuses for me!" Anna wanted to tear out of her hold, but she was weak, too weak even with the surge of fear that was running through her veins. She was losing control again. She would slip. "I'm not going to let you make excuses for me, I'm not, I'm to blame–"

"Anna," Elsa said, quietly. Though her voice was soft, it was so much stronger than her own that Anna could do nothing but listen. "I'm not making excuses for you. We all make mistakes, but we learn. You don't have to try to be perfect for me. I carved out my heart, but here I am, because you were there to help me stand up again. Now it's my turn. I'm not going to leave you behind. I'm not _ever_ going to leave you, unless...unless you really want me to."

Anna could not speak.

She shook her head.

_I don't want you to leave._

Elsa pulled her close and Anna finally allowed herself to cry. She leaned into the touch, and fell against Elsa. She could remember doing this a hundred times before, but only now could she hear a heartbeat.

"Come with me," Elsa said, and only now did Anna hear the plea in her voice. "We can leave together. We'll see all sorts of places, all sorts of people. We can find our own place. We can be happy, Anna."

Anna was afraid. She was so afraid, to try, to hurt, to fall again, but no sound left her lips when she tried to refuse. She wanted to say no. She could have no more faith in empty promises.

But Elsa made her no promises. She told her they _could_ find happiness. She only offered her the chance, and Anna longed for that chance, so much more than she wanted to refuse. She wanted to be with Elsa.

It was still just a one-word answer, but this one, Anna could manage.

"Yes."

Someday, somewhere, they could be happy.

She could try.

* * *

_I'm not afraid._

* * *

On the once-frozen shores of a fjord, there sailed a single ship.

Where the night fell and the clouds descended, the waters could not be seen. It was into fog that the ship sailed, and soon the glint of ice disappeared, masked by night.

On the lands bordered by the fjord, there stood a great kingdom once ruled by the harsh winter of a harsh queen. She had led a tortured existence. A thousand words could not express. A million letters could not convey. Sequestered high above in her cold towers, she lived a solitary life and died a slow death, trapped in the winter of her heart; but that was then, and she was free, now.

Within the dank depths of this castle dwelled a boy who was not so different. Many seasons he had seen pass. Many dreams he had dreamed. Toiling in his underground hell, lingering in the dungeons of his dark despair, his tortured path would not be swayed; but he died, having seen light at last.

And then there came a third, not from this kingdom but brought captive from her own. She stood on the earth, where the first ruled above, and the second toiled below. Herein, she found happiness and despair both. Even as she thawed the harsh frost, the snow dyed her colors white, and left a scar on her heart; but she was leaving now, sailing somewhere under the grey-black skies with the once-queen.
