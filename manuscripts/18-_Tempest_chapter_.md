**Chapter 18: Reforging Old Bonds**

"How did you – I swear, you have got to be cheating!"

Anna followed the oddly muffled noise to find Edmund in the lounge of the princes' wing, bundled up in a mountain of blankets with a mug of something that smelled delicious – hot chocolate. It was his shock of spiky black hair that let Anna know it was him. Half of his head was hidden beneath the blankets, but when his eyes flickered over to her, the rest of his face popped up with a wide grin.

"Whoa, that's a new look for you," Edmund said, blinking fast and looking her up and down, then starting all over again from head to toe. He wrinkled his nose. "Aren't you _cold_ wearing that?"

"Not really," Anna said. Her new ice dress was incredibly comfortable, and actually, Anna never felt cold anymore, not since the reliquary incident.

"…Interesting."

At the sound of his voice, Anna looked towards Gustaf, who was sitting on the other side of Edmund. On the table between them was a chessboard. It was early on in the game, but Gustaf had already captured Edmund's queen, though seemingly with the sacrifice of a number of pawns and a knight.

Knowing what she knew about Gustaf, Anna wasn't sure how to act around him. On one hand, he was one of the friendliest of the brothers, if a little distant. On the other, he _had_ attempted a rebellion against his own father, and Anna couldn't imagine too many reasons behind something as extreme as that. Elsa certainly didn't trust him, but Anna knew she was biased, horribly biased, simply because it was Markus on the other end. All of this intrigue was beyond her. She wished things were as simple as they were back at home, where she knew who to trust and there was hardly anyone who she could not.

Gustaf stared at her expectantly, waiting for some sort of reply.

"Oh, yeah, weird. So, do you two play often?" Anna asked hurriedly, and she heard Edmund stifle a laugh. She didn't even bother defending herself. "I've only seen you with Cyrus and Fabian."

"On occasion." Gustaf gestured to a seat, and Anna took it feeling a little bit like she was intruding. "Now, I will guess that you did not come for a game yourself. Were you looking for Edmund?"

Anna blinked; Gustaf was perceptive. A little while after accompanying Elsa to her study and sitting through yet another session of tedious petitions, Anna had decided to find Edmund and see if she could help patch things up between him and Elsa. Elsa could use a friendly face, and Anna felt she owed Edmund that much, at least, for everything he had done.

"I was, but you two should keep playing," Anna said. "Don't mind me, I'll just watch."

"It's not like we never play anymore, just less often," Edmund cut in. "But one thing that's stayed the same, I still can't win." He shrugged while moving a piece. "I've gotten loads better though."

"_Humiliamini igitur sub potenti manu Dei ut vos exaltet in tempore visitationis_," Gustaf intoned. Anna looked at him helplessly until, with a heavy sigh, he translated. "Be you humbled therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in the time of visitation."

"Uhh, that's from the Bible, right?" Anna asked.

"Indeed," Gustaf chuckled. "You are not like Elsa. She would have understood the line, even in Latin. _Factum est silentium in caelo. Dum committeret bellum draco cum Michaele archangelo_."

"There was silence in heaven. Then the dragon entered battle with the archangel, Michael," Edmund translated, and Anna gave him a smile.

"What do you think of those lines?" Gustaf asked.

When Edmund made no move to answer, instead staring at her curiously, Anna nearly jumped. "O-Oh, you mean me? What do I think?"

Gustaf smiled, but Anna privately thought it didn't reach his eyes. It was a polite smile, not exactly fake but not genuine either. "Do you believe in extremes, Anna? Good and evil, angel and dragon."

She thought of Elsa, supposedly a tyrant but only trying her hardest. Angel and dragon. Was Elsa one or the other? She was a dragon who loved her, an angel with blood on her hands. "No," Anna said at last.

"Good answer. Better than Elsa at this, at least," Gustaf said. Anna never had a chance to ask about what Elsa had said before Gustaf added pensively, "Justice is not a matter of black and white."

"This brings me back," Edmund said. "Elsa used to play chess with us, and we would talk about these things. Feels like forever ago, but now that I think about it, it's only been a few years."

Anna nodded. "She told me that she used to be close with you, but…" She paused and turned to Gustaf. "Nothing about you. Only that she wanted to…exile you, and Edmund tried to stop it."

Gustaf remained silent for a long while, and even the room seemed to darken with the tense mood. Anna's gaze flickered to Edmund, and she saw him hold his head down. Finally, Gustaf gave Anna a thin-lipped smile. "My wife and child are gone. Because I was too impatient, too reckless," Gustaf said. "I have learned patience, I have learned caution, but…much too late. There are only…shadows, now."

Rising from his seat, he left without another word.

Anna watched Gustaf go, speechless, until he turned a corner and vanished. Edmund slowly unraveled his blankets. Abandoning all pretenses of drinking the hot chocolate, he instead laid it down on the table and looked away, sighing every now and then, all the while furiously rubbing his temples with his face set into a grimace. Anna had no idea what was going on. Something was wrong, something she was in the dark about.

"Did you need me for something?" Edmund asked suddenly. Whatever bout he suffered from had passed. His trademark cheer was back, even if just a little forced, and Anna was glad for it.

"Oh!" Anna sat up. "It was just – I know Elsa regrets how things ended up between you, and I took your advice from before, I've been trying to make her happy again…"

"Making good progress," Edmund said, grinning impishly and nodding at her new dress. "I'm just going to ask this straight up. Are you two together now–"

"_That's not the point_!" Anna fanned her reddening face, but Edmund laughed uproariously anyway and she realized she had all but admitted to it.

"So what is the point?" Edmund snapped his fingers. "Oh, I forgot to ask. About the chocolates–"

Anna had nearly forgotten to be angry about that. She had no idea how to make chocolates, only how to _eat_ them, and she doubted she could get the chefs of this foreign kingdom to teach her without some royal pressure. So, she had enlisted Edmund. After flatly telling her she was severely underestimating herself – something about being close to Elsa – Edmund had, Anna believed, very graciously decided to help. Obviously, he had instead sabotaged her efforts.

"No wonder you told me not to taste them," Anna growled, stalking forward while Edmund laughed nervously and backed away. "Anna, you're going to eat them all, I'll taste them for you instead. That's what you said. So why, exactly, did you tell me they were fine?"

"They _were_ fine, I never said they were _great._ Look on the bright side! It was more interesting this way, good atmosphere, right?" Edmund ducked under a blow and laughed again. "But Elsa liked them, right?"

"I'm just glad she didn't get food poisoning," Anna retorted, but she let the issue slide. She had been the one to mess up anyway.

Edmund smoothed out his jacket but then rolled up the sleeves as usual, sloppily bunching them around his elbows. Anna had wondered why he was looking so proper today, but she remembered that Gustaf had been around. She'd never pegged Edmund as someone who cared so much for what others thought.

"So what do you need exactly?" Edmund asked.

"I think it'd be a good idea for you two to patch things up," Anna said. Gods knew Elsa needed someone else she could trust. "Oh, and Saul too."

Edmund took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, puffing out his cheeks before making a loud popping noise. "I'd like that. I mean, I – I said some pretty nasty things. I would take them back if I could, but…"

"Too late for that," Anna said. "But you can still apologize."

Slowly, Edmund grinned.

"Sounds like a plan. Lead the way!"

* * *

Elsa frowned at the reports in her hand, though she could have recited its contents word for word already. A recent drought had left Arendelle with desiccated lands, reducing much of their summer harvest, and much of their reserves had gone to relieving the Southern Isles. A vindictive part of Elsa wanted to leave the kingdom to its fate. No one had come to _her_ aid, so many years ago. She had suffered alone.

But Elsa was rational enough to know that avenging herself on people who almost certainly knew nothing of her plight was petty. Even if she were so inclined to senseless rule, forgoing everything Markus had ever taught her, Arendelle was still Anna's home; Elsa would never let her people starve. They had made a pact, after all, leniency in return for Anna. Elsa would honor that agreement, even if for no reason other than how much she valued Anna.

It might be time for a new source of goods. It was high time for her to hasten the completion of the Mirror anyway, and remaining ensconced in the Southern Isles did nothing. She discarded the reports in favor of a map, but a destination, a _target_, was already in her mind.

Weselton _was_ known for hoarding whatever they could get their hands on...

Elsa was interrupted by a knock on the door, and she blinked at the unfamiliar noise. When she realized that she really had no reason to be so surprised someone knocked for once, it took every ounce of effort for Elsa to hold back a laugh. Anna was certainly a bad influence. Did she even know how to knock?

"Why are you bothering to knock?" Elsa shook her head when she heard Anna talking to somebody, her voice filtering through slightly muffled but easily recognizable. "Just go in. I don't think she cares."

"It's called making a good first impression! Seriously, even I know that."

"First impression? You've known each other for fourteen years."

"Well, when you put it like that…"

That second voice was familiar; Edmund, Elsa recognized, and she had her second shock of the day. They no longer spoke outside of the occasional meeting when all the princes were gathered together, and the last time Elsa remembered having an actual one-on-one conversation with Edmund had been the day she threatened his life after he called her heartless, and then Gustaf had appeared to drag him away. If only Edmund knew how accurate he was, how much that would sting, he might not have dared.

"Just come in," Elsa called.

Her door creaked open. Anna and Edmund peered in, both of them poking only their heads through the door, one slightly above the other. Strangely, Anna was positioned higher than Edmund. For whatever reason, the prince was crouched and clutching the edge of the doorway.

"What are you two doing?"

"I brought him along to visit!" Anna grabbed Edmund by the collar and cheerfully dragged him into the study, ignoring his cries for help. Elsa felt a smidgen of pity for the boy.

"Are you sure it was not a kidnapping?"

"He agreed to it, but by the time we got here he started chickening out," Anna huffed.

At her provocation, Edmund sprang to his feet, hands drawing indecipherable gestures in the air. "I just wanted to make sure you weren't busy before bothering you! You might be okay with Anna popping up all the time, but you might not want to see _me_–"

"You are not so unpleasant," Elsa interrupted. "Did you need something?"

Edmund closed his mouth. Anna grinned and backed away.

"Oh. I-I just…" Edmund rubbed the back of his neck.

"I should thank you for telling Anna to give me a chance," Elsa said, gaze flickering to Anna for a brief second. She smiled and nodded softly in encouragement, but encouraging _what_ Elsa could not guess.

"Just telling it like it is," Edmund said.

"You do that often."

Edmund winced. "What I said before, I wasn't thinking and I never meant it the way it sounded. You have no idea how upset I was, but I didn't mean to be horrible. For what it counts, I – I think you're doing a great job. No one could do better."

What exactly he had to be so upset about, Elsa still didn't understand; but either way, she had never been angry or hurt by his reaction, or by any of the rejection from any of the other princes. It had been her intention to isolate herself. She could hardly resent others for only doing what she wanted. She had never been close to most of the brothers anyway, and even now she desired none of their company, not in the way she used to yearn for acceptance.

Though it was gratifying, just a little, to hear it from someone she considered an old friend.

"Apology accepted," Elsa said softly.

It was still nostalgic to see Edmund grinning widely, and the sight was enough to make Elsa smile a tiny bit. When Edmund saw, he asked exuberantly, "Does this mean I can call you Sis again?"

"You used to call Elsa _Sis_?" Anna interrupted.

"When we were children," Elsa sighed.

"You said you were fine with it!"

"That's pretty cute," Anna offered. Strolling up the steps to Elsa's raised desk, she plopped down into her lap without warning. Elsa did nothing except raise an eyebrow when she saw Anna lift her chin in challenge. "But I am the favorite."

"I don't think I want to compete…"

Her closed door suddenly swung open again without the slightest warning, and for a moment Elsa had the vague thought that the world was becoming a strange place indeed if _Edmund_ of all people was the only one to remember to knock. It was to her utter surprise when Saul burst into the study, gaze wild, disheveled as he almost never was. Elsa felt Anna press close against her in shock.

Saul took one look at them and his eyes widened.

Anna pulled away to her feet and cleared her throat, and though Elsa kept her gaze fixed on Saul, she could see out the corner of her eyes that Anna was nervously tucking her hair behind her ear.

"Do you need something?" Elsa asked.

"May we speak alone?" Saul looked at Edmund, and then to Anna.

Elsa was ready to refuse and even Edmund looked about to argue, but Anna bounded over and grabbed him by the arm, letting out a cheery, "We'll just find something to do!" Before Elsa could say a word, Anna had already left the room. After the door closed, Saul moved back and locked it for good measure.

Elsa narrowed her eyes. "What is this about?"

"Are you involved with her?" Saul asked.

It was an accusing tone he used, hoarse and demanding, but bitter enough that Elsa knew he must have already guessed. She had thought she felt guilty for pushing him away. When she heard his voice, she realized that she did not. There was regret, and even resentment, but not guilt. She had done the right thing after all.

"Yes," Elsa said.

"It will not reflect well on your rule," Saul warned. "The others will say that you are being influenced by some foreigner, that you are committing treason against the Southern Isles."

"Do they not speak already? Let them talk."

Saul balled his hands into fists and took a step forward. When Elsa raised her hand in warning, he halted as though with great force of effort. His eyes squeezed shut for a second before he asked through clenched teeth, "Is this kingdom so unimportant to you?"

"It is important, but I return your question," Elsa said. "Is your concern for the kingdom really why you are here, or are you using it as an excuse to criticize my actions?"

"An excuse? If I were looking for an excuse, I could use anything at all," Saul said. "You refuse to explain yourself. You refuse to listen to counsel. I have done everything I can to hold back those who would oppose you, but this time...Elsa, you cannot continue this. You are destroying yourself."

"Don't presume to tell me what I can or cannot do," Elsa said.

"I will when you are acting without a care for the consequences!"

"Will you still not speak freely with me?" Elsa asked quietly.

Saul stilled, frozen as though she had used her powers, frozen perhaps even more so, as though lead filled his limbs and paralyzed his mind. Elsa could stop someone from speaking. She could not stop someone from lying to themselves, and she knew that better than anyone. Heavy, oppressive silence filled the study, but Elsa waited for Saul to speak.

"…Why?" Saul stepped closer, and though Elsa raised a hand again, this time he did not, would not, stop. "What does she have that I do not? In what way am I inferior to this girl you have known for mere weeks?"

"If you must compare, then you know even less than I do."

"I have always been here waiting for you, for _years_. All I've ever wanted was to be by your side, I have given without asking for anything in return–"

"Then what are you doing now?" Elsa asked.

"I want an answer!" Saul was close enough that he could slam his hands down on her desk and glare furiously into her eyes, less than a foot away. But his rage was spent, his arms shook, and his head bowed only a brief moment after his outburst. "Just…tell me…why."

"What _have_ you done for me, Saul?" Elsa rose and steadied him by the arms, forcibly lifting him out of his stupor. "I remember everything, I will always think of you as a friend, but what have you ever done for me that wasn't for yourself?"

Saul remained silent. Pulling away gently, he edged backwards, stepping off the dais of her raised seat and back to the lower level of the floor. Just like that, he was the perfect picture of humility again. Elsa was unsure which was worse, the explosive anger that was at least real, or this acted role all over again. She and Saul had been little more than strangers even as he taught her and she gave him her trust, and that was the crux of their relationship all those years.

"I cannot give you an answer. It is something I only realized lately for myself," Elsa said.

"Because of Anna?" Saul asked quietly. "What am I to you?"

"She is part of it," Elsa admitted. "But the answer has always been there, the barrier between us. We _are_ friends, Saul. I am sorry I pushed you away, but you have never held me close either."

"I have, I always have–"

Elsa shook her head, and Saul paused, his parted lips closing soundlessly. "If you had, then we would not need this conversation," Elsa said.

"Is this your last word?"

"It is."

"I am glad that you consider us friends, then. Those years between us – I will always treasure them." His words were terse but Saul was being truthful, not mocking. Elsa could tell that he meant them, even though he smiled wryly and the tint of bitterness never quite left his eyes.

"As will I," Elsa said. "You will always be a trusted friend to me. That won't change."

Saul nodded and turned away, stepping to the door with the weary steps of a defeated soldier. When his hand hovered over the doorknob, he stopped.

"Elsa…" Saul looked back, and something flashed in his eyes that Elsa didn't recognize. Something was on the tip of his tongue, waiting to be said, and Saul opened his mouth as though beginning to speak. No sound left his lips before he shook his head and turned again, his back all she could see. Somehow, the act had a note of finality that should not have been there. "It was nothing of importance."

The door clicked shut behind him.

* * *

"Wow, what do you think is going on in there?" Edmund first pressed his ear to the keyhole then lay down on the ground to peer under the door, giving her a wink like he thought he was doing her a great favor. Anna grabbed him by the collar and dragged him up. "Will you stop doing that! God, you're way too strong for your size. What did you _eat_ growing up?" Edmund cried.

"Give them a little privacy," Anna said.

"You have to be curious too." Edmund wagged his eyebrows suggestively. "You do know that Saul has a thing for Elsa, right? You'd have to be blind to miss it. Aren't you worried?"

"There's nothing to be worried about." Anna knew better than anyone just how Elsa felt, and guarding her jealously was the last thing Anna wanted. She was more worried about the way Saul looked, so lost yet so angry, so different from his usual composure and _dangerous_. "Did Saul seem off to you?"

"Completely out of character, yeah, so if by off you mean crazy bad vibes..." Edmund shrugged. "Well, Elsa can handle herself."

"_Now_ you decide not to worry." Anna shook her head. "Can I ask you about something else?"

"Fire away," Edmund said.

"About what Gustaf said earlier, that his wife and child were gone…"

Edmund cut her off with a sharp hiss and pulled her away, moving at a brisk pace so that they were farther and farther from Elsa. Startled, Anna watched as he whirled around, eyes scanning to and fro. Only when he was satisfied that they were alone did he ask, very quietly, "How much do you know about the rebellion?" He sighed when Anna replied in the negative. "Right, I doubt _I_ know much more – I think I was only a few months old – but the rebellion failed and Gustaf's wife and infant son were exiled."

"So Elsa wanted to send him to wherever too," Anna said quickly.

"Yeah. To Baaj," Edmund said. Something about the hurried way he spat the name out as though it were unclean, _evil_, made Anna shiver. "That place can be called an island, maybe a prison, but it was meant for torture. Ironic thing is that Gustaf designed it too."

"Gustaf designed–"

"For interrogation, you know, spies and traitors; Gustaf was huge on policing, but after it got shut down for brutality…" Edmund looked uncomfortable and Anna could understand why. She saw where this was going. "It started being used for exiles. Which sounds okay enough, right, but what it actually means is…a death sentence."

"So then, his family…" Anna swallowed. "They're dead."

Edmund nodded gravely. "Elsa has no idea, and to be honest, that's probably for the best. Nobody really knows, top secret and all that, but Gustaf told me and I overreacted. He barely stopped me from telling Elsa." His voice lowered. "If he lived, Odon would actually be about my age now, I think."

They shared a moment of silence. Meanwhile, Anna sat in stunned silence. Markus had murdered his own grandson. So much for the kindly father figure he portrayed to Elsa. Should she tell Elsa? But Anna doubted Elsa would believe her, and even if she did, Gustaf _had_ committed treason.

"Believe me, there are a _lot_ of skeletons in the closet. Just leave them be," Edmund said, his eyes far-off and gaze unfocused. For once, Anna remembered that he was older than her, had likely seen and witnessed much more than her sheltered life in Arendelle ever permitted.

"You think I shouldn't tell Elsa."

"What would it accomplish? Don't drive a wedge between you two for our sake. It wasn't easy getting this far, right?" Edmund smiled and clapped a hand on her shoulder. "I appreciate the thought, Anna, but let our problems be our own. Thirteen brothers of the Southern Isles. None of our troubles should be yours."

"If you think that's best," Anna said.

"You must think our family is just a den of vipers," Edmund laughed.

"No, I wish I could." Anna leaned against the wall and took a deep breath, exhaling as she slid down and slumped on the floor. "It's like the more I learn, the more complicated everything becomes. How do you do it? Get through all this, I mean."

Edmund sat beside her, tucking his knees against his chest. "Everything will be all right one day. I hold onto that dream, and I know I'll make it happen."

"And people say _I'm_ optimistic."

"After all, optimism is my only redeeming trait," Edmund said, tapping the side of his head. "If I didn't have that, I'd be pretty empty inside. Always keep the faith, Anna."

"Good advice," Anna mumbled.

She just hoped she could manage to do that.
