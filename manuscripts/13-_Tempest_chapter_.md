**Chapter 13: One Persistent Thought**

"Alek!"

Hans observed from the edge of the room as Saul scoured the hallways, shouting incessantly for the buffoon. Well, he was on the right track; Alek had stalked through not long ago, looking even more wretched than usual, and Hans wisely decided to stay out of sight. Gods knew why he looked so murderous, but Alek had always despised him. It might have been an opportunity to nudge Alek towards some foolhardy idea or another, get him killed in some crusade, but Hans wouldn't put it past him to try something violent in the mood he was in. No, Hans knew better. On the other hand, Saul…

"I wouldn't suggest bothering him," Hans said, stepping out to the open and smiling when Saul flinched at the interruption. "Ahh, sorry for surprising you."

"No, I apologize for not noticing. I was too focused on Alek," Saul said. Unfailingly polite as always, but Hans was used to being unnoticed in favor of others. Some part of him wondered if Saul realized how his words could be construed, but it hardly mattered anymore.

"Alek left to the training grounds. If I were you, I would leave him to his usual mindless sword-waving; I believe that works for him," Hans said. "What's put him in such a mood?"

Saul shifted. "A long story. I hardly know where to start."

"Hmm. Queen Elsa, I suppose?"

"In a manner of speaking," Saul said, slowly, now crossing one arm over himself to clutch his elbow. Not from cold, Hans could tell. "But not through any fault of hers. It's only that–"

"No, I understand. I didn't mean to say that it was," Hans said, smile widening when Saul relaxed just a little. It was best to let them think they were safe, make them drop their guard and show their vulnerability, and then what you said next disoriented even more. Keep them unbalanced. Stay in control. "Though even you must admit that Elsa has a long history of wronging us."

And just like that Saul was defensive again, face hardening with steel, but he was thrown off balance and Hans knew. "Queen Elsa is our rightful ruler, and I will not tolerate any disrespect."

Hans held up his hands in mock surrender. "Of course, I forgot. You've been her staunch supporter all this time, Saul. Advocating her rule even as the rest of us chafe under her command. Working tirelessly in the background to lessen her burdens."

"What are you trying to say, Hans?"

"I'm saying that despite everything you do for her, Elsa doesn't appreciate you," Hans said, voice like silk and cream, gentle but all the more hurtful for his lack of venom. Saul stilled, lips parting before he swallowed, dry-mouthed and speechless. "You deserve more, Saul. You, who should have been king."

"I-I don't know what you're saying," Saul said quickly, shaking his head and retreating a step back. "I have always given you respect as my brother, and I expect the same in return. Speak no more of this."

"It's because we are brothers that I say this. Elsa is only the rightful ruler because Father made her so, but anyone could tell that she isn't the best choice." Saul continued to shake his head weakly, but he offered no rebuttal. Hans stepped forward and added with vicious glee, "You are."

Saul remained silent, only looked down, but his silence said much. Even he had to have entertained the thought before, when a commoner girl with no royal blood in her veins suddenly overtook their throne.

"Out of the thirteen of us, you are the best," Hans continued, pacing like a shark smelling blood on the water. "You are the wisest of us. You are the most able, and I admit this freely. It isn't fair that you toil away for nothing when this kingdom should have been passed to you, not to Elsa."

"Enough," Saul muttered.

"I realize that you think you love her," Hans said, laying a hand on Saul's shoulder, and his brother flinched like the touch burned. "And that is perhaps why you continue to allow this utter travesty to continue, but Saul – Elsa has never appreciated you. As your brother, I have to tell you that you deserve more than to be second-best to an incompetent, worthless little girl from Arendelle–"

"That's enough!" Saul threw off his hand, breathing deeply and clenching his jaw so tightly Hans could see a muscle pulse in his cheek. "This is treason!"

"Tell me that you don't feel slighted," Hans said. "And _Anna._ Tell me that you think Anna could ever compare to you. You were always there for Elsa, but Anna? What has she done but taken what belongs to you? After all this time, do you not deserve to have Elsa?"

"You already have so much to say. So why don't you tell me, since you seem to know so much?" Saul challenged.

Hans smiled. "You answered my question with a question. That's an evasion."

"You–"

"Don't give up the throne because of some foolish sense of altruism," Hans urged. "You can have both this kingdom and Elsa if you would only act for yourself. The Southern Isles and Elsa are rightfully yours, and Anna? Anna is nothing but an obstacle."

"I refuse to listen to more," Saul said, speaking through clenched teeth, turning away and tightening his fists so his hands would not shake, but Hans noticed the tell-tale tremble all across his body. "Goodbye, Hans."

"You know I speak the truth," Hans said, watching as Saul left. He did nothing to stop him. The seed had been planted, and now all that he needed was time to let it grow. They could play some other time.

And in the meantime, there was always Anna as a distraction.

* * *

Elsa gazed out the window of her study as she so often did every day of the past week, just to make sure her eyes hadn't fooled her for the past six. Her storm had stopped. Not _her_ storm in the sense that she had ever been in control of it, but the storm caused by her reliquary. For nearly six years it had raged with neither end nor even the slightest hint of weakening; and yet now it abated, leaving only a calm plain of white snow without the howling blizzard.

She spent much of her time with Anna, and strangely that was usually at Anna's request. Elsa admitted some confusion about the girl's behavior the past week; Anna had insisted on accompanying her no matter what she did, even toiling away at paperwork, and Elsa knew that staying still and quiet for hours at a time was hardly something Anna enjoyed. It was honestly perplexing.

Not that Elsa minded. It was something of a relief to have her company, a welcome break from the monotony even if sometimes Anna was perhaps _too_ enthusiastic. Just now she had taken a look at the clock and sprinted out, yelling something about coming back quickly. Elsa was growing used to her quirks and thought nothing of it. Was this peace she had found, with Anna?

But whatever she felt now, it didn't feel like peace.

Her head hurt.

She grimaced as another throb drummed through her skull, bringing with it another memory she had repressed for all these years. They were coming stronger and stronger. With practiced ease she blocked it out, imagining herself mechanically filing it away in some dark, decrepit corner of her mind. They were only hindrances muddling her thoughts, and she needed nothing of them. Let them rot away.

Anna said that shutting out her emotions was lying to herself, but Elsa wasn't so sure. Happiness, excitement, warmth; those things she felt around Anna, those things Elsa wanted back. But her memories, her weakness, her pain? It was only human nature to avoid unpleasant thoughts. People couldn't linger in the past forever without losing themselves. Wasn't there a saying that people had to move on and look to the future? She had taken it a step further, but that was only the logical extreme.

Yet another pang that felt like a spike being driven through her head, and no amount of rubbing her temple could ward off the pain. Long ago she had developed a habit to distract herself in case any stray thought of the past slipped through. On instinct she resorted to reciting in her head the litany of texts she memorized. In her mind's eye, she could see the exact lines on the exact page: _Faust_ by Goethe, Scene Five, Lines 1112 to 1117.

_In me there are two souls, alas, and their
Division tears my life in two.
One loves the world, it clutches her, it binds
Itself to her, clinging with furious lust;
The other longs to soar beyond the dust
Into the realm of high ancestral minds._

And _Macbeth_ by Shakespeare, followed by Webster's _The White Devil_, then _Frankenstein_ by Mary Shelley. She closed her eyes and visualized the pages with perfect recall, seeing their crinkled edges complete with text, borders marked with her annotations. Elsa scrambled the texts together so the words ran together into an incomprehensible jumble; then picked out one strand and traced it to its source, reconstructed it from the beginning until it was back in order and distinct from the muddle. A strange habit – perhaps too chaotic for anyone else to understand how it could possibly be calming – but for Elsa it was as good a method as any for driving away distracting memories.

She couldn't afford to be distracted. Not only did she have to keep the Southern Isles afloat, she had to hasten the finding of the Mirror if she hoped to ever revive Markus. Almost a month had passed since Arendelle, and to her complete and utter surprise, there had been no sign of a shard or even a splinter of the Mirror there. She could sense them, in a way. Hear the whispers of the fragments yearning to be complete again. But there was nothing; Arendelle was a mystery to her.

And then this new development of the Sorcerer lurking in the shadows…

Elsa was so preoccupied that she missed the door opening. Only when a file dropped onto her desk did she open her eyes.

"You seem distressed," Gustaf said. It was his voice that first alerted her of the eldest prince, a deep drawl that resembled the rumbling of a landslide, stone grinding upon stone. In a way, he reminded her of Markus; Gustaf looked so similar to his father he could have been mistaken as the same person.

It only set her on edge.

Elsa forced her hands away from her forehead and masked the pain, but even her indifference was a paltry act compared to Gustaf. There was a mask she could admire, one of apathy and atrophy. Markus had never been one for traditional primogeniture, preferring merit; and it was once said that he had replaced Gustaf, the eldest and most likely candidate for Crown Prince, because of his lack of ambition. Elsa knew otherwise.

Gustaf had tried to seize the throne before she ever stepped foot in the castle.

"What is this?" Elsa asked, but she riffled through the papers before Gustaf even answered, eyes picking out words during the split second each one was revealed. "Reports from the town?"

"Pursue it at your leisure," Gustaf said. "There are better times."

Elsa set the file aside. Dealing with Gustaf would take her full concentration. Had he brought them in for the sake of distracting her? It seemed petty. But why else would he personally bring them? "I admit many things have been chaotic as of late. But rest assured that everything is under control."

"I have never doubted your ability." Gustaf claimed a seat without invitation, bulky frame and dark furs of his overcoat almost completely masking the white of her sofa. He fixed her with a heavy stare. "Only your motivation. To be frank, ruling suits you ill."

Elsa frowned at the old jibe, the rumor that she had taken the throne by force, but from Gustaf it was especially insulting. "What exactly are you trying to insinuate?"

"Entirely the opposite of what others might think. I know you have no desire to rule," Gustaf said, shrugging. "Father has burdened you unfairly."

"Hardly unfair, given all that Markus has done for me."

"Has he really?" Gustaf hummed from the back of his throat. "Well, believe what you will, but you cannot tell me you wish to rule when it is so exceedingly obvious otherwise."

"Who else would rule in his stead?" Elsa asked, clenching her hand so ice would not erupt with her frustration. It stung that he was right. It was a tiring, thankless rule she took on, and one she longed to relinquish. "Yourself, Gustaf? You, who tried to usurp his father's throne?"

As if deliberately angering Elsa further, Gustaf only laughed away the offense, waved his hand like he could brush the ugly past aside. "It was a foolish notion of my youth. Idealism, you know. I thought I could make the world a better place. Bring justice."

"…Was there something else you needed?" Elsa could feel the migraine coming back.

"No," Gustaf said, rising to his feet almost laboriously, both hands pressing down on his knees to support himself. "I only wanted to visit, for old time's sake if nothing else. It's been too long since you've been among us mortal ilk. Isolate yourself too long, and you'll lose sight."

"I haven't forgotten. I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing," Elsa said.

"I wasn't talking about Father and his crusade." Halfway to the door, Gustaf paused and turned his head just a fraction. "You know, Elsa, you were much more open-minded as a child. Do you remember what it was like, back then? Maybe you've lost something."

Before Elsa could answer, Gustaf walked out and shut the door behind him.

* * *

When Anna had realized any normal lunch hour had passed and Elsa _still_ hadn't eaten a thing the entire day, she sprinted off.

Anna nearly ran into Gustaf when she returned from the pantries, charging around the corner without a care and skidding to a stop inches before what promised to be a painful impact. In her hands, a plate covered with a dome wobbled dangerously.

"Whoa, sorry," Anna said, laughing nervously when Gustaf eyed her like she was some particularly ugly insect he was debating whether or not to squash. "Didn't see you there."

After a long, terse moment and the silence stretched on rather uncomfortably until Anna began to think about just walking around him, Gustaf finally chuckled. "It's of no consequence, but take care in the future. You're too…excitable."

"A little?" Anna shrugged.

"Well, I suppose that's part of the charm." Gustaf chuckled again and Anna stared, not quite sure what to make of the compliment. "I must take my leave, but feel free to find me for a game of chess."

"Sure." Anna waved as Gustaf went the other direction, quietly thinking that the day she joined another game of chess – and risked getting decapitated by a stray piece flung at her head – would be the day hell froze over. Although she was about as close to that situation as anyone could be, really…

Well, whatever.

Anna continued on her way, balancing the plate in one hand and her other hand unconsciously playing with the strand of white hair. It had been long enough since she left that she knew Elsa wouldn't be in her room anymore; Elsa rarely spent any time there outside of sleep, and Anna knew she barely slept so it was really just the few hours of night she decided not to work. So, office it was. Anna was close, only a few seconds away – even at a slower walking pace, to avoid any repeat incidents – and she assumed Gustaf had left Elsa's office just now.

When she opened the door, Elsa looked up with visible irritation. It was more than a little surprising to see her with eyebrows knit together and lips drawn into a tight grimace, but as soon as Elsa noticed it was Anna, she relaxed. After giving the plate a bemused glance, she looked back down to her reports with a sigh. "Nobody knocks now," Elsa murmured.

"Maybe you should just keep the door open," Anna quipped. She still closed it behind her though. Elsa liked her privacy.

"I may as well," Elsa said. "I wonder if the rest are taking cues from you."

"That's just unfair," Anna grumbled. "So what did Gustaf want? I ran into him outside just now. Literally. It was pretty awkward–"

"Be careful around him," Elsa said, frown deepening and pen jabbing out her signature with unnecessary force. Ink splattered in a line across the page, but Elsa hardly seemed to notice.

"Why? He seems pretty all right. Invited me to chess, but I'm probably going to bail. Cyrus and Fabian can get _vicious_."

"I would advise you to be careful around the majority of the princes, but that's a precaution. Around Gustaf, being careful is a necessity," Elsa said. "You don't know this, but Gustaf tried before to take the throne from Markus."

"…Wow. You really can't tell from the way he acts," Anna muttered. Out of everyone, Gustaf, the guy who played chess and practiced fancy writing all day? She would have expected Tobias to pull something like that, not Gustaf. "How did that happen?"

"It was before Markus found me, but I hear that Gustaf enlisted the aid of court officials to try and force Markus to abdicate, the excuse being an inability to rule due to old age–"

"No, I meant…" Anna interrupted. "Well, why did he do it? There had to be a reason."

Elsa stopped with pen halfway to the page and blinked, looking so stunned that Anna could tell she had never considered the question. "I don't know. I never thought to ask."

"At least he wasn't being murderous like Tobias," Anna said. "Is that why he's still around?"

"More or less," Elsa answered. She rubbed at her temple again with her free hand, a habit Anna was fast discovering to be chronic. "And Markus spared his son because he is, after all, his son."

"Do you have a headache again?" Anna walked up the dais, set the plate down, and plucked the pen from Elsa's hand. She set it aside out of her reach. "I think you need a break."

Elsa shook her head and reached for the pen, but Anna snatched it up again and held onto it, taking the reports for good measure. "No, I still have a lot to do. Corona, especially. They're having a shortage, but resources are spread thin as it is–"

A part of her wondered about how Arendelle was faring. Anna still missed and loved her home, she really did; but for the life of her, she couldn't find the subject important enough to bring up when Elsa was obviously suffering from what would likely develop into a migraine at any moment. Her _own_ head was starting to throb, and if just the backlash from their link was that bad…

"Elsa, you're not going to get anything done the way you are. Have you even eaten?"

"I don't need to," Elsa said. "You know that. My powers are enough to sustain me."

"That's no reason not to eat! That can't be healthy, living off…uhh, magical ice," Anna said. She pushed the plate towards Elsa and lifted the dome, revealing a tempting array of _healthy_ food, not all chocolate like she had been tempted to get.

"You're one to talk about healthy eating." Elsa nudged the meal aside and held out her hand, lips pursing into a thin line when Anna only threw the reports aside and raised her chin. "Anna. This isn't the time for games; I don't have time to dawdle."

"It's not a game, I just want you to take a break before you kill yourself." Anna pushed the plate towards Elsa again, only for her to nudge it aside again.

"…Anna, I don't need it and I don't want it," Elsa said, something dark flashing through her eyes. Anna noticed, but she ignored it.

"You're going to eat, and that's that."

"It would just be a waste of time–"

Another attempt which Anna failed, but she wouldn't give up that easily. She tried again, followed by another try, and then another, pushing the plate closer and closer each time; and each time Elsa's frown grew deeper and deeper, her refusals more and more impatient. Until finally, when Anna was close to force-feeding her, Elsa snapped.

"_I said I don't want it!_" Elsa's voice harshened into a low growl, and she sprang to her feet, swung her arm so strongly she flung the plate out of Anna's hands. Ice arced from her fingers and followed the direction of her swing, hardening into a thin layer of rime over her desk before spiking upwards into a row of tapered spears.

Both of them stopped and stared, Anna at the ruined meal sliding down the wall and Elsa at her ice.

When Elsa came back to her senses she jerked back and looked away, clutching her closed hand to herself and breathing deeply. "I didn't mean – I-I'm sorry. Please, Anna, just…just leave me be."

She was doing it again. She was going to hide away again, in fear of hurting her, but Anna knew she never would. Not even accidentally. As close as the ice had come, it had stopped.

Carefully, Anna reached past the spikes; Elsa shrank back in her chair and drew her hand back further, following Anna every inch of the way with her eyes. But though her breath hitched, Elsa did nothing when Anna gently took her trembling hand in hers. Letting out a tiny sigh when Elsa refused to budge, Anna tugged her hand free and opened her closed fingers one by one, rubbing light circles over her skin.

"See, nothing happened. I told you I'm not afraid," Anna said, smiling when Elsa only stared, speechless with wonder. "You don't have to say sorry all the time."

"But I could have…"

"You could have, but nothing happened," Anna said. "I just want you to take a break. I pushed a little too much, I know, but you really need it and – I wish you would take better care of yourself."

Elsa shook her head and stood, pulling away from Anna with a light tug. Before Anna could ask what she was doing, Elsa crossed the room in two quick strides. Bending down where the plate had shattered against the wall, she picked up a piece of bread, brushed it off, and slowly bit into it.

"I know," Elsa whispered.

Anna felt something warm inside, spreading from her heart like it pumped liquid joy instead of blood. She couldn't be sure if it was her or Elsa. All she knew was that she couldn't stop grinning, but still…

"Maybe we should get you something else," Anna suggested. "That's all dirty, and–"

"This is the best food I've ever had," Elsa said, continuing to savor the grubby piece of bread like it was really the greatest thing in the world. "You brought me this."

"Y-You're just saying that." Anna drummed her knuckles together and laughed nervously, but Elsa smiled softly and seemed to have no intention of taking it back. She meant it. "It's not even chocolate, so it can't be the best."

"Next time you can bring me chocolate then." Elsa scanned the mess of food again, but not much else was still edible. Anna could see glass shards embedded in some of the rest.

"Don't hurt yourself!" Anna dashed forward and stopped Elsa, leading her away from the glass. "I'm glad you ate, but you don't have to, really, none of that is even any good anymore."

"I'm sorry for wasting your efforts," Elsa said.

"Then you know how you can make it up to me?" Anna backed away holding both hands together at her chin, trying her hardest to contain her excitement, but she couldn't help bouncing back and forth from one foot to the next. She grinned so widely she was sure her face would hurt if she wasn't so caught up with her idea, and eventually she bit her lip to hold back a squeal. It was such a spontaneous thought, but now that the inspiration struck it was persistent. She could hardly wait. It was so perfect.

"Anything," Elsa promised.

Anna smiled and asked, "Do you want to build a snowman?"
