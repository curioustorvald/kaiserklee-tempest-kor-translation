**Chapter 21: Two Fronts**

It was her first time standing in the court, excluding the brief minute when she had burst in on Elsa about to kill Andersen for spreading rumors about her. Anna had no idea where to stand. Saul had made himself comfortable on Elsa's throne, face blank but radiating quiet satisfaction nonetheless. It made Anna's skin crawl. Even worse was when she noticed how his fingers unconsciously caressed the arms of the throne and Anna privately thought that she didn't need vibes to tell something was off with him. The other ten princes were lined numerically in two rows on opposite ends of the room, leaving Anna to stand awkwardly in the center.

"You are the guest of honor," Saul said, and he gestured to his right. "You may stand here, Anna."

"Oh. Umm, thanks." Anna would have preferred to stay on the lower level, but even she knew when a request was really an order. She walked up the steps of the dais to her spot but put as much distance as possible from Saul without looking deliberate. From where she was, she could see all the princes clearly. Some of them looked more upset than others. Nobody really looked that happy, except for Reid.

And strangely enough, Hans.

"Saul. What do you have to say?" Stefan asked, his voice the blandest monotone, but Anna was glad for the directness. Everything about him screamed disinterest: his eyes were half-lidded, his expression was neutral, and every now and then he would curl a lock of his red hair around his fingers.

"I would like to take this chance to remind you all that, despite the fortunate circumstances of our birth, ability and drive is still a thing to be admired." Saul cast a sweeping gaze over the room, and Anna noticed that Edmund flinched. "Perhaps some of us have forgotten that lesson in favor of lethargy."

"Nicely done, Eight," Fabian muttered. "If by ability you mean being good on your knees, you are certainly the best. I envy your skill in pleasing the witch."

"Making excuses for being pathetic," Reid snorted.

Anna wasn't one to judge by appearances, but Reid looked very much like a rat, and a mean, starved one at that. It was his demeanor, however, that she disliked. The first time they crossed paths Reid had spat in her direction and said something derogatory, though not very clever. Between Reid and Fabian, who always made lewd jokes about her, Anna wasn't sure who to root for. Hopefully they would fight.

"Big words coming from you," Fabian said. "Tell me, why exactly does Saul keep you around–"

"I prefer listening to music and not this crass bundle of innuendo. Let's try to at least pretend to be civilized," Rafael said. Without sparing a glance at the others he continued picking at his fingernails, though the tiny curl at the edge of his lips was obvious.

Fabian bristled. "Mind your elders, _Seven_."

"You should act it, then," Rafael replied, making a show of flicking his fingers in the older brother's direction. Only when Cyrus tugged at his arm did Fabian subside. "It's like the moment Elsa is gone, you all feel free to act like wild animals."

"Make this quick, Saul," Stefan said again.

Saul nodded. "As you wish. I refer to one person in this room who has neglected his duty, and such neglect cannot go unpunished. Do you have anything to say for yourself, Alek?"

Up until then, Alek had been staring off into space looking unduly bored by the proceedings – Anna suspected the straightforward blond had little patience for this sort of wordplay – but at the mention of his name, his eyes narrowed. Stepping forward with his head held high, Alek asked, "What exactly have I been neglecting?"

"You are the Captain of the Guard," Saul said. "Why, then, have all these incidents been happening? First Alvard, and then Tobias. What explanation do you have?"

"That's a little unfair–" Anna began, but Alek cut her off.

"I have no explanation. You know as well as I do what happened."

"You admit to negligence, then," Saul sighed, and Anna looked to him in utter disbelief. Elsa had told him exactly what happened, that they had died because of the Sorcerer. Saul only shook his head like he knew nothing about it. "I confess that I am disappointed."

"Me too," Alek said, looking straight at Saul.

"Nobody knows what happened to Tobias," Rafael said.

"Exactly. How strange is it that the death of one of our brothers should have no explanation? It is unacceptable. If he were still alive, Alvard would never have allowed such a thing," Saul said, and if Anna had been angry before, now she wanted to slap him. Saul had to have known how much that would hurt, and as expected, Alek looked ready to attack him.

"I don't know, Alek, I don't feel too safe," Reid snorted.

"Keep your dog in line," Alek snarled, not sparing Reid a second glance and ignoring his retort in favor of taking a step towards Saul. Edmund rushed forward to hold him back, but Alek easily shrugged him off. "Do what you want, but at least leave me my dignity."

Saul bowed his head. "It's for the best, Alek. It is with regret that I announce, from today on, you are stripped of your position as Captain. Your replacement will be," Saul said, pausing for a moment, the tiniest of smiles replacing his show of regret, "Hans."

Everyone, Anna included, looked to Hans standing in the back quietly and unassumingly, but he seemed completely at ease. At the news, Hans took off his gloves and strode forward, bending to one knee as though he had known this would happen and rehearsed. "It is my honor to serve."

"…Really?" Stefan asked.

"I assure you that my choice was made after careful consideration," Saul said. "I'm sure our youngest will bring some badly-needed new direction."

Hans rose to his feet and turned, sending a victorious glance at his brothers. Anna noticed that he had avoided her eyes. When he stood, he had looked anywhere but at her. "I have the utmost confidence," Hans said. "I'm more than up to the task."

"And if you are not?" Cyrus said, backed by similar words from several of the brothers, Rafael still politely cutting and Fabian easily the loudest – Thirteen was useless, he said, Nine was much better. Surprisingly, Reid said nothing. Instead, he just stood there, staring at Saul with his mouth hanging slightly open and hands clenching into fists. Saul paid him no mind.

"That's enough," Saul said, waving his hand. "Everyone starts out somewhere. I have one more announcement to make."

"You will not be exiling any of us, I presume?" Gustaf chuckled, but it was obvious the uneasy atmosphere his words birthed. Especially for Edmund. Everyone stood as tense as if they were on a battlefield, but Edmund paled so badly that his skin looked bone-white against the black of his hair.

"I would not dream of it. However, I worry for Anna," Saul said. Anna nearly jumped, already tense and shocked by her sudden inclusion. "You are here because of Elsa. I cannot let anything happen to you."

Anna forced herself to stop chewing on her lip and bit out a nervous laugh. "I think I'll be fine. Besides, you said just now that Hans is going to be making some changes, keeping things safe around here…"

Saul smiled. "But accidents happen."

"Maybe you ought to give Alek his position back, then," Cyrus pointed out.

"Save it," Alek growled, but as far as Anna could tell, Cyrus had been serious.

Saul cleared his throat. "As I was saying, Anna, your safety is of paramount importance. As such, I've arranged that you stay in your quarters, and anything you need will be delivered to you."

"Wait. What do you mean, stay in my quarters?" Anna asked slowly, running the words over in her head. With each successive repeat it became clearer and clearer what he really meant, especially when compared to how Elsa had allowed her complete freedom. "Are you trying to say that–"

"Anyone who wishes to see you will be approved by me. And there will be no longer be a need for you to traverse the rest of the castle," Saul finished. "In fact, I would strongly discourage any unnecessary movement and visiting any old places, doing needless things. Do you understand?"

"You're locking me up!" Anna exclaimed. And it sounded very much like Saul knew what she had been up to just before this meeting. Just what was going on?

"I only wish the best for you," Saul said.

"Oh, you are so full of–"

"Anna!" Edmund shouted, and his voice was so shaken, so uncharacteristically frightened that Anna paused to look back. Trembling and looking deathly terrified, Edmund said, "I-I'm sure that Saul means well. Just…go along with it."

Anna was too stunned to say anything. She was torn between yelling at Edmund for his betrayal and screaming at Saul for _locking her up_, but in the end she could say nothing at all. It felt as though her throat had locked up from the force of her rage.

"I believe that settles the matter," Saul said, and he rose. Anna was sure there should be some sort of formality for the rest of them, but nobody made a move and Saul apparently expected nothing more, as he only added, "Dismissed," and then left out a side-door.

Anna stood there as the rest of the princes scattered. Hans gave her a fleeting look, finally _deigned_ to make eye contact, but Anna paid him no mind and he left without a word. She missed Elsa. She missed Elsa so badly. If Elsa were here, none of this would have happened. And if Elsa were here, Anna would have yelled at her too. Why had she given control over to Saul? What a horrible mistake.

"H-Hey, Anna."

Her head snapped up at the sound of Edmund's voice. Anna nearly saw red at the sight of the boy edging towards her, and this time she managed to shout, "What is wrong with you? Why would you go along with – I thought we were friends!"

"I know, I know, but hear me out," Edmund pleaded.

"I defended you, I said that I trusted you and then you pull this–"

"I was scared! All right? Saul just went nuts, and you heard what Gustaf said, Saul could exile us if he really wanted to, and you remember what I said that means?" Edmund took a deep breath. "I'm sorry."

Anna swallowed her anger, just now noticing that Alek had stayed behind as well and was walking towards them. "You might have actually made the situation worse for yourself if you said any more," Alek said. "Edmund did the right thing stopping you."

"Fine," Anna said.

"I really am sorry," Edmund said again.

"No, I get it." Anna sat down, not having the strength to stay standing. Right now, all she wanted was to flop down, close her eyes, and never get up again. "Three days. This is all going to be over in three days. When Elsa comes back, Saul is going to get it."

"I doubt it," Alek said. "It's restrictive, but you _are_ safer if you don't wander around like usual. Elsa will probably end up agreeing with him as long as he spins it right. Saul is a tricky one."

"What about you?" Anna asked. "How are you doing?"

"You've been Captain of the Guard for so long, Hans is just…" Edmund grimaced when Anna shot him a glare. "Come on, I'm not saying he could never do it, but definitely not better than Alek."

"Saul is trying to stop me from investigating. I don't have any manpower now even if we find anything," Alek muttered. "And I definitely have less excuse to be searching around."

Edmund tilted his head. "Wait, what are you investigating–"

"Is Saul the Sorcerer?" Anna gasped.

"_What_?"

"I was trying to be discreet about it," Alek groaned, but Edmund was already looking from Anna to him and back waiting for an explanation. "Whatever, I just – I don't even care anymore."

"We think Alvard and Tobias were actually manipulated by some Sorcerer," Anna explained. Edmund listened mutely as she recounted the theory, how Alvard had been under control when he tried to kill Elsa, how Tobias had been cursed and died before he could say who it was he conspired with. Slowly, Edmund's eyes widened, but not once did he make a sound. Even when Anna finished, Edmund only stared vacantly as though the information was too much to handle. It might really have been.

"I'm sure one of us is the culprit," Alek added.

Edmund snapped out of his trance. "No way." Swallowing, Edmund licked his lips and repeated, "There's just no way. We're brothers."

"Brothers? I would very happily break Saul's legs right now free of charge," Alek said. For the life of her, Anna couldn't find it in herself to disagree with the violence. She thought she might join in. "Though if it ends up that Saul is the Sorcerer, I guess I wouldn't be able to. What about Hans? Just now Saul gave him my spot. Seems convenient."

"I'm telling you, Hans is innocent," Anna said.

Alek groaned. "How do you know?"

"Vibes," Anna said. But to her surprise, Edmund didn't laugh at all. Instead, he put on a strained smile and looked away while Anna continued, "I'm serious, I think we can trust Hans. I just know."

"Vibes aren't reliable–" Alek began.

Edmund shot to his feet so abruptly that Anna jerked back on instinct. Looking to her and then Alek with a feverish energy surpassing even his usual enthusiasm, Edmund blurted out, "I think – I need to go." And before Anna could say anything, he had sprinted away as though hell were at his heels.

"Do you think he's all right?" Anna asked.

"Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine," Alek said, but he spoke offhandedly and stared at the path Edmund had taken with far too much interest. "Will _you_ be fine? I should probably go too."

"_Perfect_," Anna said, more than a little put off by being given the cold shoulder. "And if you'll excuse me, I think I need to get back to my cell."

And if the guards – _escorts_ – coming through the doors were any indication, she was right.

"I would prefer there to be no casualties, or if necessary, the bare minimum."

Elsa allowed a moment for her order to sink in, and she watched as Oliver scratched the back of his neck like she had spoken in a foreign language. As the rotund man continued to blink wordlessly, Elsa redirected her gaze to the map spread across the wide table aboard her ship. Weselton lay at the end of a narrow inlet separating the larger landmass in two, the entire city walled and gated. But the city itself spanned both sides of the river. Homes had spread across to the other end, and so even the stretch of river that led to its docks was enclosed with a gate.

"It _would_ have been my suggestion to use that gate as an avenue, but going that way would be too…flashy," Oliver said slowly. "In that case, casualty is almost guaranteed."

"Stealth seems to be the only viable option," Elsa agreed.

"So that's why…" Oliver muttered, but Elsa doubted he had meant for her to hear.

It had been a great surprise to everyone when, rather than use her usual full-force tactics, Elsa had chosen to quietly isolate the small port town on the edge of the inlet. Once, she would have announced herself and then crushed any opposition to serve as an example. Instead, this time she simply built a dome of ice around the entire town in the dead of night, effectively cutting them off from Weselton. No one would be leaving to warn the larger kingdom what was to come.

"Do you have any other suggestions?" Elsa asked.

"Your Majesty, I hesitate to ask, but…" Oliver took a deep breath, shoulders hunching, and Elsa waited for him once again. It was a good five seconds before he asked, "Why all this? Before…"

"I have never treasured life and I never will," Elsa said. Though Oliver looked stricken by her answer, Elsa truly felt that way. It was just like Markus said. People were selfish and cruel and rejected what they didn't understand, sought to destroy what they couldn't control. Elsa knew that better than anyone, but… "But I made a promise and I intend to keep it."

Anna was the exception, not the standard, and Elsa would feel nothing killing her way through the city if not for the fact she knew it would disappoint Anna.

"I-I see," Oliver said.

But then, even if Anna was a fluke, flukes could happen twice. What if among those she would have unwittingly killed was someone like Anna? What if she had _already_ killed someone like Anna? Even Anna herself had come close to death that day in Arendelle. If she had tried to resist, or if she had just been caught in the crossfire of the battle…

"I find myself more and more confused these days," Elsa confessed.

"I may be overstepping myself again, Your Majesty, but with all due respect, broadening one's views is never a mistake," Oliver said, fiddling with the edge of the map and scanning every region of it in a desperate attempt to avoid Elsa's eyes. "Even confusion is sign of a widening scope."

"Sound advice," Elsa said. Oliver might have smiled, but he bowed his head further and if he did, it was lost on Elsa. By the time she sat down next to him, Oliver was back to business.

"I have a plan. Since Weselton will have no warning…"

* * *

It had only been a day since her imprisonment began, and Anna was ready to bust the door down if need be.

Maybe she was too used to the freedom Elsa granted her, but being locked in a room almost made her claustrophobic. Not even _her_ room, though by that she really meant Elsa's room. Instead, she was moved to some isolated wing of the castle she had once passed by and found completely deserted. The door had only been opened once in the evening, when a meal had been delivered to her by perfectly polite servants who nevertheless knew how powerless she was and answered none of her questions. After that she was left on her own, and so for more than twelve hours the only voice Anna heard was her own screaming at Saul. Once she exhausted herself, she fell asleep still mumbling insults.

Anna woke up feeling the least rested she had in months.

She could not do this anymore. If she had to stay in that room any longer, she would go insane. Not knowing how the investigation was going on Alek's end, being in the dark about any news from Elsa, all of it gnawed at her mind until Anna decided that when the door opened for her breakfast delivery, she would make her escape. Before long, she heard the customary knock, though maybe a bit more forceful than usual. Situating herself at the edge of the doorway, Anna waited for her chance.

The instant the door opened, Anna swung it wide open. The servant boy still barely held on to the doorknob, stumbling but staying on his feet; Anna shoved the boy down entirely before sprinting down the hallway, yelling at the top of her lungs, "I did it, I got him!"

She knew she would be pursued so Anna ran without even thinking about where she was going, delighted by the freedom and the _space_ to actually be able to run. Was that maybe a bit too easy? Oh well. It was too bad she was unfamiliar with this part of the castle, because as the twists and turns became more and more complex, she began to lose track. Eventually, her steps slowed out of necessity. Anna took deep breaths to recover and looked around in the meantime.

"Hey, the kitchens," Anna said aloud.

She walked closer, intent on breakfast since she _had_ skipped it, but before she could even reach for the handle, the door swung open by itself. When it opened, she wasn't greeted by cooks or servants as she had expected but Reid, looking drunk out of his mind; Anna could smell the alcohol on his breath even standing two feet away, but more alarming was the fury on his face. On reflex, Anna took a step back.

"Oh. Hey," Anna said carefully. Her eyes flit about the room for something she could use if things turned ugly. Judging by the murderous vibes Reid emitted, she may as well think _when_ and not if.

"What are you doing out of your cage?" Reid asked.

"Excuse me? I can go where I want," Anna said, but she inwardly winced the moment the words left her mouth. She needed to work on her temper.

Reid sneered, brow furrowing so that crow's feet rimmed his bloodshot eyes. "You don't seem to understand the situation you're in right now."

Before Anna could react, Reid reached out to grab her by the arm. His hand shot forward with a dexterity that betrayed none of his drunkenness, and Anna could only brace herself. What she was _not_ expecting was for Reid to jerk back the instant his skin made contact with the fabric of her dress, hissing under his breath and clutching his hand to his chest.

Not fabric, Anna realized. She was still wearing the ice-dress Elsa had made.

"Stupid wench," Reid growled, but now he eyed her with the angry wariness of a wounded animal. "You think that dress is going to protect you forever?"

"Look, I've never done anything to you–"

"Like hell," Reid said. "Just your being here makes me sick. This is _our_ kingdom, _our_ throne. Bad enough that we have to let that peasant bitch play at being queen, but now we have to deal with you too?"

Anna saw red. Forgoing the common sense telling her to just leave while she could, she threw herself at the insufferable, foul-mouthed man in front of her. Reid knew better than to touch her dress this time. Anna found herself stopped as easily as a leaf in the wind, her chin caught in his grasp, and then she was dragged further into the kitchen. Just as the pain kicked in, her more rational side returned.

And with it, fear.

"Let's have a drink," Reid said, pushing Anna down to a seat at the table where he had likely sat. Anna flailed against his hold, scattering bottles of wine, but when that proved useless she scrabbled at the hand gripping her chin like a vice. She scratched hard enough to draw blood, but Reid just laughed and picked up a glass, thrusting it into her face so roughly the rim cut into her chin. Faster and faster, Reid forced the wine into her open mouth.

Only seconds passed before Anna began spluttering. She was released when the glass emptied, but she broke into violent coughs as the alcohol burned its way down her throat. It wasn't a long respite. She was grabbed again, another glass brought to her mouth and alcohol forced past her lips, overflowing until it spilled onto her face, her dress. All the while, Reid laughed hysterically. Anna couldn't breathe. More and more alcohol, but it was the lack of air that made her vision blur, her eyes roll backwards, and as the wine started to burn in her nose and eyes she thought she might drown right there–

Until she was torn away to sweet reprieve.

Air rushed into her lungs so powerfully she doubled over, but Anna could tell someone was holding her. Even while coughing so powerfully her knees shook and her legs trembled, she could tell, especially when that person steadied her so she never fell. Blearily, Anna pushed away her wet hair to see Hans glaring at Reid, who was sprawled across the table and bleeding from the mouth. Hans gently leaned Anna against the wall, and then straightened.

"Walk away now and Saul doesn't need to know about this," Hans said.

Reid slowly drew himself up. "Look at Hans all grown up–"

Hans snarled. Before Reid could recover, Hans grabbed the older brother by the back of his head and smashed his face into the table. A loud crack and a muffled scream echoed through the kitchen. Hans dragged Reid by his hair to the door before bodily flinging him out and slamming the door.

"Th-Thanks," Anna said. It was all she could manage for now.

Hans shook his head and led her to a seat, then went to rummage around the kitchen before returning with a towel. Numbly, Anna dried out her hair as best she could. Hans put his coat around her shoulders and stoked the flames so it was a little warmer, and as Anna curled into the jacket, slowly she calmed. Nothing had happened. It could have been worse, but Hans had been there and everything was okay. She just really, _really_ needed to learn to control her temper.

"Are you hurt?" Hans asked.

"I-I'm fine," Anna said. It was obvious that she was not. A bruise was forming on her face already, fingerprints marring her jaw with mottled yellow. But maybe it was lingering adrenaline, because she barely felt affected by the alcohol. It would probably kick in later, but for now she felt clearheaded and alert, practically strengthened.

To Anna's surprise, Hans frowned. "There's something I hope you can promise me," Hans said. "From now on, never lie to me. Not even to be polite. It doesn't suit you, Anna. You're the type of person who tells someone what they need to hear and not what they want to hear."

"Then can you promise to never lie to me either?" Anna asked.

"You're shrewder than you let on," Hans said. "Let me ask again, then. Are you hurt?"

"Probably," Anna said, smiling despite herself when Hans hid a snort as a polite cough. "I'll feel it more a little later but right now, I'm fine. So, your answer?"

Hans smiled, more of a tiny uplift at the corner of his lips than a smile, but it was close enough. "If I promise you, then will you promise me too?" Anna nodded, and a moment later, Hans nodded his head too. "All right. I promise."

"Why?" Anna asked.

"No particular reason. I ought to," Hans said.

"Then what if there are some things I just don't want to talk about?" Anna asked again. Her more rational side, a side that sounded suspiciously like Elsa and Alek, was telling her that Hans couldn't be trusted. For all she knew, this arrangement to be truthful was just to get information out of her. But…she trusted Hans anyway. And it wasn't because he had just saved her. She just _knew_.

"You can directly tell me that you don't want to talk about it," Hans answered.

"All right," Anna said. "How about we ask each other questions?"

Slowly, Hans nodded. Anna waved a hand for him to begin and he asked, "Why Elsa?"

"O-Oh." Anna tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear, struggling to contain her nervousness but laughing a little anyway. "I told you already. Don't you remember? It just–"

"It just has to be. I remember," Hans said. But he wasn't looking at her when he answered. Instead, his eyes were staring unfocused at something Anna knew he wouldn't share. "It's your turn."

"There _is_ something that I want to ask, but you don't have to answer," Anna said. Ignoring Hans' questioning gaze, she took his hand and laid his fingers flat. Then on his exposed palm she wrote six letters.

T-H-R-O-N-E.

Anna drew back and watched as Hans slowly curled his fingers. "Do you want it?" Anna asked. She had expected Hans to choose not to answer, though even that would have been an answer in itself. Or maybe he would stall. Maybe he would still lie.

Instead Hans answered immediately, "Yes. More than anything."

"Why did you answer?" Anna asked. "If I told anyone, you know what would happen. If I told Elsa, you know what she would do."

"I know you won't tell anyone," Hans said, smiling softly and completely at ease. There wasn't so much as a hint of tension anywhere in his posture or his face, not like the last time they had spoken. "And I didn't want to miss this chance. I haven't been able to speak freely to anyone for years. Only you."

"Y-You remember what I said last time, I'm sorry–"

"I know. It just has to be Elsa, I know I don't have a chance," Hans laughed. "But I still want to just talk. Nothing wrong with that. No ulterior motives, I swear."

"Yeah. Yeah, that's definitely okay. More than okay," Anna said. "Thanks again for helping. How did you find me?"

"Alek and I went to Saul at the same time asking to see you," Hans said. "When we got to your room, we found out you had run, and then we split up looking for you. I was just luckier."

"Good thing you did," Anna said. She held back a shudder at the thought of what might have happened if Hans hadn't shown up.

"There was something else I wanted to ask. I heard you were looking into Alvard–"

"Anna! Where are you? Anna!"

At the call of her name, Anna looked to the closed door. She recognized that voice. Bounding up from her seat, she went to open the door and saw Alek pacing around not far outside, and at the sight of her he sighed with relief. Jogging over, Alek opened his mouth to say something before noticing Hans and promptly shutting his mouth again.

"I take my leave," Hans said. Giving Alek a nod, he pushed past and strode away.

"Is everything all right?" Alek asked.

"Yeah, but it's a good thing Hans was around," Anna said. "So what were you going to say?"

Alek turned his head, but Hans was out of sight. When he spun back around, Anna was shocked to see the wild excitement in his eyes shining feverishly bright.

"I have a lead."
