**Chapter 47: Hell Is Empty**

She had to be dead.

Elsa felt weightless and disconnected from any sensation. She could hear no sounds, see no sights, smell no odors, and for a very long time she simply existed, hovering between heaven and hell. Her thoughts were muddled things, only half-formed before they were swept away by memories. Upon review, she decided that her life had been a sad thing, and that it finally coming to an end was not so terrible. How had she died? All she remembered was being swept into the sea, caught in the tempest…

She was grounded again by fire burning through her body. Elsa curled inwards to shield herself as best she could, but there was no respite from this pain. When her hand scraped over sand and she felt the coarse grains scratch her skin, she realized, with some disappointment, that she was alive.

It was another very long moment before she managed to open her eyes.

She had washed up onto an island.

Day and night was indistinguishable here. Everything was obscured behind grey fog, and Elsa could see no more than five feet into the murky miasma. It all looked the same. When she looked up, there was no hint of the sun, or the moon, or even of stars, only pitch-black darkness that resembled a gaping maw. She couldn't hear anything. Not the quiet rhythm of water lapping at the shore. Not the wind blowing in from the sea. Everything was _still_ here, as though suspended in purgatory.

Suddenly, Elsa was no longer so sure she was alive.

Olaf was nowhere to be found, and she wondered whether he had survived at all. She knew she was still holding onto him when the sea took them, but she couldn't remember what happened after that.

She was alone.

Elsa forced herself to her feet, barely managing a few unsteady steps before stumbling. It was so _cold_ here. She wanted to give up, though she needed, craved, warmth; and yet that was only an instinct of the body. Death might still have been a relief to her mind, but…Anna. She needed to stay alive and return to Anna. She couldn't leave Anna to her fate. All this was _her_ fault, born of _her_ weakness.

Right now, she needed shelter if she was going to survive. Hunched to protect her chest from the pervasive cold, she forged through the darkness.

Dreary was an understatement. From the instant she took a step, Elsa was struck by the feeling that she was trespassing, as though this place were some hallowed ground or an unholy dwelling – or perhaps both. Every moment she spent here only made her more agitated, as she disturbed the stillness. Her labored breaths, stinging with the cold, thin air that filled her lungs, shattered the silence. Wherever she walked, she kicked up a cloud of dust from the beach, clogging her eyes and dying the fog blood-red.

Once she stepped off the beaches she was surprised to feel paved stone underneath her feet, albeit cracked and torn, more violently than time would have done. Evidence of civilization. So this was not an uncharted, uninhabited island as she had assumed; but she could not recognize it from her studies. Elsa squinted her eyes to see, and she could just barely make out shattered ruins. Remains lay all around her feet, hunks of carved stone too ornate for nature to have created. Metal, too, twisted remnants whose original purpose she could only guess at. And–

Elsa heard a dull crunch, and she looked down.

She was stepping on human bones.

Elsa flinched at the sight of a leering skull, and at that exact moment, the fog cleared as though blown aside by a hurricane. Instantly, the entire island was revealed. Elsa saw the devastated terrain she walked upon, the carnage, the slew of skeletons strewn carelessly on the ground; but somehow worse than that was the island, and her first thought was that the island itself appeared tortured.

It was surrounded by mountains; but mountains of twisted metal and warped stone spires that jutted into the sky and ended in cruel points, blocking off all but the small inlet she had been swept through. Everything on the island was dead. It resembled what the world must have looked like at its most primitive, a raw, primal expanse of dirt and dust and rock. Great schisms divided the red earth – Elsa traced the uniform rifts with her eyes and found they led to a hulking complex at the center of the island.

Elsa had done little more than _look_ at the structure, and she was assaulted by a wave of nausea.

**_Who…are you…?_**

Something had touched her mind.

All at once, the entire island seemed to come alive with malevolence. Perhaps she had disturbed something resting here, something that pervaded the island. She felt a chill wind phase through her body, bringing with it whispers that echoed in her ears, moans of a long-forgotten pain. Her blood turned cold when she felt gazes coming from the darkness, invisible touches ghosting over her skin.

Without thought, Elsa ran away.

She had nowhere to go, not really, not when turning back would lead her back to the sea and going forward would bring her to whatever had brushed over her mind. Elsa ran to escape the anguished wails, which mocked her naivety, jeered at her failures. Elsa ran to get away from the squirming touches, which pulled at her ankles and threatened to drag her down. She had never before been so afraid. She was _powerless_ now, and the thought that she could do nothing to defend herself gripped her with chilling fear; so much that she thought _fear_ would choke the life out of her if these voices did not.

When there sounded a low groan in her ears, close enough that Elsa could feel an ethereal breath fan over the back of her neck, she cried aloud and stumbled. Something pulled at her leg and she collapsed fully, landing on her front into the red dust, but her screams were smothered behind an invisible hand. She felt her eyes widen painfully as _things_ crawled over her back, binding her limbs. Elsa flailed with her one free hand, clawing at the ground for leverage, but she only pulled herself inches forward. She could do nothing but look at the complex ahead, and the touch on her mind returned, curious, desperate…

**_Why are…you…here…?_**

Both her mind and body assaulted, Elsa tore through her restraints and screamed.

Whatever was ahead retreated hastily, and the whispers quieted, the touches vanished. Though the fog did not return, the island quieted again. Elsa lay there for a long time, simply recovering, feeling her stomach churn and acid burn its way halfway up her throat. She half-expected this to be a ploy, but nothing else came. Now that she had a moment of peace, she wondered why that presence had pulled away. It could have been her imagination, but when the _thing_ had retreated, she thought she could sense guilt. It had not meant to harm her at all.

Elsa shook her head and wobbled to her feet again, feeling her body sting with renewed pain from the hollow of her heart. She really had nothing to fear anyhow. She was going to die soon regardless.

She was so close to the complex now that she decided to make her way inside.

Once again undisturbed, Elsa had more time to observe the great structure. It was an antiquated fortress, horribly austere, as though even its designer hated the place. Little more than a block of carved stone plated with metal, the defining feature was its _lack_ of any feature. No windows could be found on any part of the fortress. No unnecessary ridges, spires, towers, anything that would make its drab aesthetic more appealing.

But the doors were open. Elsa paused at the entryway, gazing inside, but there was nothing, save for her imagination. Just some sort of audience chamber, perhaps, long since deserted. When she was struck again by the cold, not just external but internal, she stepped inside for the sake of warmth. As soon as she passed through, the doors swung shut, but she no longer felt fear of this place.

Instead, she was only curious.

She felt that she was supposed to be here.

Though there were no windows, some dim light filtered through the fortress enough that she could see. Elsa wondered if it was coming from something inside. As she advanced, the light grew very slightly stronger, not nearly enough to illuminate every shadow, but she at least would not fall. It was warm, too. Dank and humid, but warm, and compared to outside, the air here was so thick that she thought she felt it shift aside as she moved. Elsa imagined there might be great bloated beasts waiting in the darkness, and so moved along quickly past the empty entrance chambers.

Why was this place here?

Elsa had her answer once she opened the next door and was assailed by the smell of blood.

She was familiar with the scent of death and decay, but never to this extent. Saturated with blood, even the air smelled and tasted of the copper tang; and, having been trapped within these four walls for so long, the putrid stench was worse than anything she had ever experienced. Elsa averted her face for a moment, waiting for her eyes to stop watering, and then she carefully made her way inside.

On either side were rows of jail cells, but all the doors were open and their contents thrown into disarray. Blood splattered the walls, and many of the cells contained the skeletons of their occupants, with their skulls crushed, their bones snapped apart. Perhaps those skeletons she had seen outside were prisoners too. Elsa could see why they chose to attempt escape. Living conditions here were squalid. She entered one of the cells, barely large enough for an average adult to stand at full height. Grime covered every bit of spartan furniture, the bed that was little more than a splintered plank of wood and the thin sheet that was matted with what was likely the prisoner's own blood.

"Why are we here?"

Elsa whirled around. She swore she had heard the voice of a boy, but there was nobody else.

She stepped out of the cell, searching carefully for the source of the voice. Instead, her attention was drawn to the whipping post stationed between the cells. Spots of dried blood adorned the floor, and the instant Elsa looked down she could suddenly _hear_ guttural screams echoing, echoing in her head. Her head swam. She placed her hand over the post for support, and then her vision flashed. She saw a man tied here, spread-eagled, as cruel men tore into his back for sport, laughing at his cries for help.

Elsa backed away, but the lingering agony still haunted her mind.

There was so much angry resentment here.

Why was she feeling all this pain?

No matter where she went, she was haunted by the dead. Just further up ahead were gallows, and Elsa could see the men and women who had been hanged there long ago, could feel for herself the snapping of their necks, the slow suffocation as they dangled helplessly. Guillotines, not only for execution but torture as well, and Elsa saw prisoners with their limbs amputated, people who were mutilated. Spikes to throw prisoners upon, paring knives to peel off their skin, hot pokers to set them aflame. All sorts of tortures that could not be described, and Elsa witnessed every single one. Not only adults, but children too, weeping and not understanding their fate.

Elsa had thought she grew numb to suffering, but this was too much.

"I don't like this place. I don't wanna be here."

It was that voice again, but this time, Elsa caught a glimpse of the child wandering ahead, just before he vanished into the darkness.

She thought she could recognize him.

Elsa walked past the torture chambers – and that _was_ what this prison really disguised – and deeper into the fortress. Beyond the cells was yet another door, but Elsa paused just before entering. She looked back, struggling to find some way to convey the tangled mess of emotions she felt at that moment. Finally, she gave a respectful nod towards the fallen, hoping they had found solace from this place. Empathy was not like her, and she surprised even herself with the act. Maybe because she knew she was going to die too soon. Maybe because she had really been able to _feel_ their pain.

Through the door was a long staircase leading down, down, down.

Elsa wasn't sure how long she walked through the darkness, until she came to flat ground at last.

In the chamber beyond, there was nothing of the carnage from before, nothing but unremitting black, a thousand shades of darkness for which there were no names. But there was rancor also, resentment so strong that it made the bitterness of the torture chambers look like nothing by comparison.

Amidst the darkness, Elsa saw the translucent figure of the boy, and then he flickered away.

But she knew that he had seen her too.

In the center of the room, the darkness was lifted, slowly, as pale light emanated from _something_ and staved off the dusk. Elsa shielded her eyes as the light flared. Its angry pulse flared, until finally the darkness was pushed back and the light dimmed. It was a momentary victory. Almost immediately, the shadows began to build again at the corners of the room, and they would spread before long. For now, though, the source of the light was revealed.

It was a translucent, prismatic sphere. Hovering over a plinth so that it rested at eye level, the orb contained what Elsa instinctively knew to be the source of the presence that touched her mind. Its thousand facets glimmered and refracted the light that emitted from a solitary blue flame.

Elsa approached, drawn, because she could recognize the orb for what it was.

It was a reliquary, and it belonged to that little boy she had seen wandering about.

It belonged to Edmund.

* * *

Anna laid a bouquet of flowers at the base of the gravestone.

They were not real flowers, only imitations sculpted from ice, but they would have to do. She leaned down to brush off the snow covering the top of the headstone, making sure the marble was pristine, and then traced the engraved letters – _Prince Gustaf of the Southern Isles._ It was the first time she had been here. Whether in this new life or the last, she had never visited the cemetery before. Death scared her then, and it still scared her now.

"But then, I don't need to be afraid anymore," Anna murmured.

It had been always been a point of contention between them, Gustaf and Edmund.

She could still imagine Gustaf speaking in his baritone, telling her, she had _never_ needed to be afraid. Life only had meaning because it must come to an end. Life was about the search for meaning, not necessarily the finding of meaning. All of Gustaf's old platitudes still echoed in her head, and she could imagine his disapproval. She could imagine him telling her that he had given her a second chance, but not for this purpose.

_Pardon the cliché, but it is not the destination that matters, Edmund, but the journey._

"No," Anna said. "Only the destination matters. All roads coalesce into a single point. All causes lead to one outcome. And my destination, my happy ending…"

_Have you found it?_

"Yes."

She still remembered the old pain, when every moment she spent on this earth had been torture, when lattices of utter hurt ran throughout her mind and body. But then she had been reborn. Her very first sensation was that the pain was gone, and that was all that mattered. It was like a curtain had been flung open and the world had gone from dark to light, like she had been plunged into an ice-cold spring. Every essence of her being was immersed in bone and blood and sinew, surrounded by infinite warmth. She could feel the pulsing of her heart again, and oh, the joy of rebirth!

But that moment of exhilaration was gone, and in its place…

_Have you really found happiness?_

"Yes!" Anna slammed her hands onto the headstone, growling, but now that the voice had gone silent, her anger only grew. "I have found happiness! I perfected myself, I took back everything that I lost!"

Anna straightened but did not leave, and instead she stood there, laughing. She laughed with all her might, so hard that her throat dried and her chest throbbed, and then her eyes began to sting too. She only realized, after tasting salt on her lips, that she was sobbing.

Oh, she could feel the old burning, the old hunger and ache.

What was her purpose now?

Vengeance had been her master for so long, and the search for salvation, the desperate desire to become whole again. She had done all that already. Markus was dead, and Edmund – unfeeling, imperfect, unloved – no longer existed. Every bit of him had been eradicated, as he had wanted. Only Anna remained, but what was left now? She was even beginning to feel discomfort again. Not the old, sharp pain she had long withstood, but a dull ache inside. It was a hollowness that she still could not fill.

Not even with this heart.

_Do you regret?_

"No!"

Anna clutched her chest, gasping, when her heart clenched. She fell to her knees, but this heart, which had once belonged to Elsa, continued to throb. She could bring it under control. As soon as she was calm again, but right then, she was the furthest thing from calm. Dimly, she registered that a strand of her hair had turned as white as snow. Gustaf still mocked her even after his death, still managed to make her _doubt_ her path. She never wanted his second chance.

What she had now _was_ her second chance.

"No, I don't regret. Do you hear me, Gustaf? I have nothing to regret!"

Anna released her grip and instead punched at the grave, slamming down with her fists again and again, so that she now sprawled over Gustaf's tomb on all fours. She pressed her face forward, lips parted to utter a guttural snarl. Her pupils dilated and the sclera of her eyes turned red with the spidering veins.

"I won! Do you think I care about your approval? Who do you think you are? Do you think you can just leave a letter after you _die_ and expect me to give up everything I worked so hard to achieve?"

Anna clenched the gravestone between her shaking hands. She hated this silence. She wanted to hear him defend himself. She wanted him to realize that he was wrong.

His last words were still burned into her memory.

_Your name was Odon, but you are now Edmund and there is nothing so wrong with that. Now you know everything, but you are your own person. You can be whatever you choose to be._

"I _hated_ being Edmund," Anna said, but the angry crescendo of her voice, the timbre of her roars, had broken and scattered into the wind. Suddenly she was that boy again, the boy who had become so lost that he no longer even knew who he was, and could not recognize his own face without his mask. It was Edmund who murmured, "I don't want to be Edmund. I don't want the pain."

Gustaf would never answer him again.

"I want to have purpose, but there's no purpose to be found anymore," Edmund said. "Because that's all life has ever been to me. It's just the road to death. And that oblivion…invalidation…I was always afraid, I'm _still_ so afraid. I want everything to stop."

What did he do wrong?

Nothing.

Anna took a deep breath to center her thoughts, and Edmund was no more. She no longer needed him. She did not need to doubt. Just as her control returned, her heart calmed, and she knew what she had to do. Her purpose was renewed. Anna rose, brushing off the snow that clung to her dress.

She had never made great use of the Mirror before now.

It was high time that she began.

* * *

Elsa remembered that Edmund had sacrificed his heart.

Here was his reliquary, surrounded by death.

Her first thought was to destroy the reliquary. Not because she could do anything to harm him now, when he had already replaced his reliquary with her own; but because here was proof that they were alike. She understood Edmund just as much as she hated him. She remembered the brief, reluctant kinship she had once felt for the Sorcerer upon hearing his words. They were two of a kind, the fallen and heartless. His despondency was so much like hers. His despair was only a reflection of her misery.

Edging closer to the dormant reliquary, Elsa studied the orb carefully. It was different from hers. Even separated, her heart had shone with glowing luminosity, beautifully pure despite tragedy. But this one here was a pitiful thing. Dull, and brittle, the onyx surface cracking apart and crumbling into black sand. Soon, the flame would be exposed and die out. Even Elsa could feel the unhealthy decay, the agony that bled from the reliquary as she neared; and physical proximity was nothing in comparison to the one who must have felt this resonating in his soul. How could Edmund bear this for so long?

She would not destroy his heart.

She had committed many evils in her lifetime, but Elsa decided she _could_ not destroy his heart, not when she knew his pain better than anyone.

"How did this happen?" Elsa murmured, outstretching her hand but not quite touching the reliquary. Hand hovering over the feeble glow, she felt it pulse with curiosity. Greedily, its aura pushed into her palm, desperate for contact.

Before her eyes, the world shifted. Not any great change. All the drab grey walls remained, but the reliquary vanished, and the deterioration of the physical building regressed somewhat. Still dark, still hauntingly oppressive, but not so ruined. Elsa turned, and she saw a little boy – the same boy she had seen glimpses of before – meander his way into the chamber. His skin was naturally pale, but the pallor that overcame his face was result of fear rather than inheritance. When his black eyes fell on Elsa, he did not react. He looked past her and continued walking, hunched and rubbing his arms. Before long, he had made his way close, and he seemed to have no intention of stopping.

Elsa felt a brief chill when the boy continued without pause, the edges of his being becoming translucent as he walked right through her body.

"Edmund," Elsa whispered, but he did not respond.

She knew his face. Even younger than she remembered from their first meeting, but undoubtedly Edmund, the same spiky black hair and soft, delicate features that she knew well. Elsa had known him from the time he was six years old. How old could he be now, to be here in this wretched place?

"We begin your lessons today."

Elsa did not need to look back to know that it was Markus who had spoken. Backing away and standing at the side of the room, she observed the younger, healthier king stride towards the little boy. When Edmund reached out for comfort, Markus shoved him away. Edmund flinched and held his hands close, and Elsa could see why; Markus held such irrational anger in his eyes that even _she_ was shocked. Not merely the anger of this moment, of the show of weakness, but bitter antagonism that ran too deep.

Markus was not looking at Edmund. No, that gaze was meant for someone else.

With that, their lessons began. Markus coached Edmund through the use of shadow magic, and the boy, though he looked frightened beyond belief, possessed the same desperate need to prove himself that Elsa once did. Gritting his teeth, he dutifully performed everything asked of him.

Though she knew now that the Sorcerer had been Edmund, seeing the child use magic was still disconcerting. Perhaps all the more because she knew what he would become, and yet he showed none of that deranged fervor now, none of the skill that so eclipsed her own. Edmund struggled as she never had with her magic, his shaking hands barely able to conjure the slightest wisps of shadow.

"Pathetic," Markus said, and Edmund hung his head in shame.

"I-I'm sorry, I'm trying my best–"

"Gustaf was so much better than this!"

Once Elsa saw the brief spark of betrayal before Markus masked the vulnerability behind layer upon layer of condescension, she began to understand just _who_ his anger was really directed towards – Gustaf. Once, Elsa had shared his indignation at the betrayal, but now, knowing what she knew, she almost wished that Gustaf had been successful in dethroning the dark king. But he had failed, and Edmund was _his_ son. Perhaps Markus shifted all blame from Gustaf to him.

It could not have helped that Edmund looked so much like Celina.

When the flames that sprouted over his hands died out once more, Edmund turned his stricken gaze to Markus.

"I'll do better next time!" Edmund promised, but Elsa knew that nothing he could do would ever be enough. Still, she understood. Even though her memories were faked, she remembered feeling this way toward her own parents.

"You will stay here and continue practicing," Markus said, and he swept away, the billowing tail of his cloak enough to shroud Edmund.

Edmund whitened. Perhaps he was too fearful and too young to recognize dismissal. Or perhaps he was simply so desperate that he would believe otherwise, as Elsa had once believed in Markus. Either way, despite what should have been his better instinct, Edmund launched himself forward and latched on to Markus' leg.

"Please don't leave me here," Edmund said, sobbing. "Please, Father, I don't want to be alone–!"

Markus kicked him away, and Edmund landed, stunned, onto the floors. Elsa knew by experience that his tears would only anger Markus more, and she was half-right. For just a brief instant, there was a spasm of regret on his face; but then he looked closely at Edmund, studied his features, and the rage returned twofold.

"I should have let you _die_ here with your mother," Markus spat. "Baaj should have been your grave!"

Markus stormed out, leaving Edmund to cry, alone, amidst the darkness.

Despite herself, Elsa slowly made her way over to the boy. She knelt down next to him. Edmund had sat up, but he clutched his knees close and bowed his head, the entirety of his weak frame shaking with the violent force of his sobs. When she heard the painful hitch in his breaths, she almost worried that he would suffocate. She did not want to pity him, and yet she could see herself in his place. She had _been_ in his place. Already the seeds of his self-loathing had been planted. How could they not be, rejected by the one person that _should_ have accepted, loved him?

"Is this how you felt, Anna?" Elsa murmured, bringing her hand hovering over Edmund's head. "When you saw my memories, did you also begin to feel pity for me? As I now feel pity for him?"

Pity was the wrong word, Elsa thought. Understanding. Limited, maybe, but understanding nonetheless. It was more than anyone else would ever see. And they were so similar that, just maybe, Elsa really _could_ begin to understand him.

Elsa rose to her feet while the world spun, the dark colors melding and spinning outwards again into something bright. She was in the castle now, and Edmund, huddled at the fireplace. Across from him sat Gustaf, but though they were supposedly playing chess, neither of them were looking at the board. Edmund had his gaze fixed on the fire, either unknowing or uncaring that Gustaf was studying his face.

"You are not yourself today," Gustaf said carefully. "How are you faring?"

She could only have seen because she knew to look, but Elsa noticed the slight twitch in his hand, as though he wanted to reach out to Edmund. He never did, though. Had Edmund noticed too? Quickly, his eyes flickered over to Gustaf before looking into the fireplace again.

"I'm all right," Edmund said.

"Are you…sure?" Gustaf asked.

"Yeah." Edmund reached to the chessboard, moving a piece seemingly without much foresight. "Just been tired lately. Guess I need more sleep."

There were dark circles around his eyes that had no place on a child, especially stark in contrast to his fair skin. Worse than that was the flatness of his voice; Elsa guessed that Edmund was only five, maybe six, but he sounded ancient already. She had aspired to sound like this. She had done so much to repress her emotions, and here was this boy who had mastered that lesson already. It was horrifying.

"You do not seem tired around the others," Gustaf mused.

"Well…I dunno, I just have this feeling." Edmund shrugged, smiling softly. "I can let myself be tired around you, right?"

Gustaf stilled. He continued to stare, seemingly unable to decide on any response, and Elsa could not decide whether he was happy or hurt. She circled around, and proximity allowed her to see the slight bob in his throat, the twitch in his jaw. At last, Gustaf settled on nodding.

"If you should ever find yourself needing anything, anything at all," Gustaf said, rising from his seat while Edmund only looked confused, "I hope you know you can come to me."

Gustaf rushed away, and Elsa could imagine him going to grieve alone.

Once again, the world shifted, and the colors of the castle faded back into the grey of Baaj. Whatever peace and quiet that Edmund had managed to accumulate with Gustaf had vanished, and the scared little boy was once again ushered to the chamber where his reliquary would one day reside – and Elsa suddenly knew what this memory would show. Markus nudged him down the corridors of the torture chamber, and Edmund fought to keep a brave face.

"Enter through there," Markus said. "You will find a plinth in the center of the room. Upon the plinth will be a box. Retrieve what the box holds, and then you can return. Understood?"

After an affirmative, Edmund wrapped his hand around the heavy brass knob and pushed against the door, but its rusted hinges would not budge. One glance at the growing displeasure on Markus' face and he redoubled his efforts, until the door swung open, and he wasted no more time, his heart leaping in his throat. There was something different about this memory. Elsa was not simply an observer now, but more. She could feel everything that Edmund felt, every bit of fear as though it were her own.

Following him down the staircase and already knowing what to expect, suddenly Elsa found that she _was_ him, was the boy stepping into the great unknown–

Edmund eased his way down the winding path, wincing when the metal steps groaned under his feet. Still, the relative silence eased his fears. Never having been down to this part of the fortress before, he had only his imagination to fuel his curiosity; Edmund pushed away his thoughts before they could develop. He would not be afraid. He had only one simple task, and there was no point worrying.

At the base of the staircase was another door similar to the first, but smaller and more decorative. Once again, the unoiled hinges, rheumatic, stayed obstinately still. Edmund pushed the door with all his might and, as soon as there was enough space, slipped through the gap.

Unconsciously he had held his breath while entering, and now he breathed a sigh of relief. There was nothing so special about the room. Only a standard chamber room, windowless, but all the areas of Baaj were completely walled. Featureless grey stone, as was the norm, and the stench had long since stopped bothering him. In the center stood the plinth, its three prongs coming together to support a small, slender box.

Edmund made for the plinth.

Halfway there, he stopped and looked behind him.

Nothing, and yet he had the strangest sensation of discomfort. For some reason, the door through which he had so recently entered, slightly ajar with barely enough space for him to fit, now seemed unsettling. He thought he had seen it quiver just a bit. Edmund wished that he had thought to close it behind him. But there was no need. He would be going through again in just a few seconds.

Hastily, Edmund made his way to the edge of the plinth.

He whirled around again, sure that there had been a noise…

But the room was empty, and as intently as he listened, he could hear nothing but the sounds of his increasingly ragged breaths. He turned back to the plinth. Rather than walking too close, he stretched out his arm as far as he could – not necessary, but for some strange reason he wanted to save time, to get out as quickly as possible. Sweat had begun to build on his forehead. Edmund swung his fingertips out wildly, rocking forward and yet keeping back all at once.

There resounded a throaty chuckle, right behind him.

Edmund knocked the box over as he wheeled around, but there was nothing there; and then there came careful taps and clicks from the walls, and he stumbled back, tripped over his feet, fell against the plinth.

Nothing there.

He remained leaning against the cool metal, paralyzed with anxiety, until his eyes fell on the box lying beside him. Hand shaking, he flipped the lid to reveal an ornate kris knife, its oscillating blade carved with runes that he could not understand. Edmund gripped it tightly, reassured, for just a moment, that perhaps he could hope to defend himself–

Something laughed, softly, in his ear, and he felt an oily touch brush against his neck.

Edmund lashed out with a cry, but he made no contact. Scrambling to his feet, he ran for the door and prayed for any god that might hear him.

Something came behind him. Edmund heard its breathing and its heavy, thudding steps at his back.

He was almost at the door, could see the stairs beyond.

And the door slammed shut.

Edmund hammered at the doorframe while wrenching the knob, called to his father in a choking sob, but all for nothing. There was the whispering at his ear again, incomprehensible words, hisses and snarls and whines. He beat at the door until his hands bled. There was no reprieve, and he began to feel _anger_ then, anger at his weakness, and it was _anger_ that fueled him past the mortal panic.

He turned to the empty room and held out the knife with both hands.

Small sounds were all around him, low moans and high screeches that joined together in an unholy cacophony. Though nothing could be seen, there was the echo of quiet pattering, of taps and clicks against the walls.

"Stop!" Edmund shouted.

It did not cease. As though to taunt his weakness, the sounds came closer, and closer, until he could imagine that _something_ was bearing down on him – Edmund whipped his arm forward to ward off whatever was coming, and responding to his terror, his magic sent a pulse of darkness rippling through the halls. It washed over every inch of the stone, suffocating all within reach with his desperate horror.

And then he saw the truth about that place.

Great beasts filled every inch of the space before him, hulking things that were hunched and terribly deformed. They had responded to his magic. They had swallowed his terror and been given form, nightmares fueled by his own imagination. None of them had faces. Only masks, some with leering faces and others with blank, porcelain gazes, but all of them had the same distorted limbs stretched into grotesque proportions, the same tortured forms with erupted spines and jutting ribcages. None of them had hearts. They had been torn out. There were wings and scales and tails, and enough beasts that they squatted in every corner, hovered in midair, piled atop each other, their horrific moans echoing.

Once Edmund saw them, they, too, realized that he could see them.

They leapt.

Edmund screamed, falling against the door and sprawling onto the floor, curling into himself and raising his hands to protect himself. His mission, the knife, spun out of his hand, forgotten. Smothered by the terrible noises and the great stench of death, feeling the spectral touches against his skin as the beasts fought for his heart, he forgot all thought but of survival.

It was a primal thing, his instinctive desire to preserve his life.

And when it failed, his next thought was to protect himself from the terror by _ending_ his life.

Edmund found the knife again when his scrabbling hands fought for purchase, and the desire to end things was so, so strong. Anything to stop this torture. Anything to escape this hell.

_Stop!_

Elsa forced herself away from him, struggling to separate her identity, but their link was still present even as her mind raced to fill in the holes that Edmund was too young to understand. All of these mindless beasts were the remnants of Markus' experiments. It was Markus who was planting in Edmund the suicidal command now, to force him to carve out his heart, and the sheer depravity – Elsa knew what would happen, and yet she screamed when the deed was done.

Edmund stabbed himself in the heart.

Instantly the magic of the knife ripped out his heart, and Elsa was _still_ connected to his mind, was forced, once again, to relive the agony of separation. She felt her heart seize, the core of her being drawn out by the darkest of magic, siphoned away even as her failing heart continued its futile resistance. In its last moments, the heart beat the strongest. Her organs felt ready to burst, blood found its way out from her nose, her eyes, her ears, her mouth, and she felt herself torn in all directions until it seemed that she would split apart. Elsa screamed as Edmund screamed, until, finally…

His heart stopped beating.

His blood stilled in his veins.

But there was something terribly wrong, worse, even, than what Elsa knew. Her own reliquary had been entirely separate, and the pain became a distant memory as soon as the process ended; but something had gone wrong here. Edmund was still connected to his heart by a bare thread, so that his heart constantly fed the pain back to his body; and his magic constantly tried to snap the connection. Every moment of his life, his own magic was _killing_ him.

Elsa had not realized when she fell, but she collected herself and half-walked, half-crawled to where Edmund was lying, broken. His mouth was agape, but his voice had long since left him, and his eyes, though wide open, were glassy, unfocused. He looked so vulnerable that he appeared even younger than he really was, this five-year-old child who was now mutilated.

Someone was coming.

Elsa had expected Markus to arrive, but rather than coming through the door, someone else was phasing through the walls in half-shadow form. Gustaf rematerialized, looking devastated as he looked upon his mutilated son, but Elsa was just as angry at him as she was at Markus. She had no more pity.

"I-I was too late," Gustaf said, and then he no longer spoke, only mouthed, _Ina, Ina, Ina,_ over and over again. His trance was only broken when–

Edmund gasped.

Life resurged in his eyes, glassiness giving way to sudden, vicious clarity, and like a marionette pulled by its strings he sat up, doubled over, his limbs swinging to and fro in spastic movements.

Gustaf immediately caught his diminutive hands when Edmund began clawing at his face, actually managing to gouge furrows from his eyes to his chin. Holding the boy close through his manic episode, Gustaf began to cry. It was the first time Elsa had ever seen his calm break, and for a moment she could not believe her eyes. Gustaf begged Edmund to calm down, begged him to come to his senses, and eventually, the pain settled. It would always be there, but Edmund finally stopped his flailing.

"G-Gustaf…?" Edmund mumbled.

"I'm sorry I could not protect you," Gustaf said. "I'm sorry I was too weak."

"I don't…I don't…understand…"

"Markus will kill you to keep you silent," Gustaf said, laying his hand over Edmund's head. Elsa knew what he was doing. Implanting suggestion. "You must pretend you have forgotten all this. Act as the person you always have been. Do you understand?"

"Y-Yes…?"

When Markus came to collect an unconscious Edmund, Gustaf was gone.

Elsa closed her eyes to this hell.
