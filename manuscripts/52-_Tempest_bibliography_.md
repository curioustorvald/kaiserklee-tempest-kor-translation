**Thanks, Dedication, and Notes**

It has been a very strange year.

On December 30, 2013, I posted something that I never intended to be anything more than a drabble; and now, more than a year later, Tempest has finally been completed at over 260,000 words.

It feels surreal to be sitting down and writing this page now. It hasn't quite sunk in that Tempest is really finished. Because the task seemed daunting sometimes, frustrating other times, and most importantly, it was always there; Tempest became such a big part of my life that I can hardly imagine really being finished. Truthfully, the past year had its ups and downs, but being able to come back to Tempest was always something of a relief. Not only because writing is therapeutic, but because of all my readers, and all the people I had met through writing.

Which is the reason for this post---I want to thank each and every one of you.

I am so thankful for my readers, whose encouragement drove me to continue writing. When I first posted, it never even crossed my mind that there would be such a positive reception. Everyone's encouragement, the favorites, the follows, the reviews, all of those things have been not just flattering, but truly gratifying. For someone who always viewed writing as a guilty pleasure but not much else, seeing that people could really enjoy my work became incredibly validating. I read every review, and I was, and still am, thrilled when I get a new one. Now I'm seriously considering a future in writing, and I am deeply grateful that you all helped me find this direction to pursue.

Thank you to all the readers: those who have been here since the beginning, those who found Tempest in its middle, and those who will read Tempest in the future.

Tempest is dedicated to **Sydney**, who helped me through the worst of times, and **Sol**, who inspired me to write.

Now then, I promised people I would discuss some of the themes / symbolism found in Tempest.

On a larger scale, one of the greatest conflicts is the search for purpose. There are three different viewpoints expressed: Edmund's nihilism, Anna's (quasi) existentialism, and Elsa's (eventual) absurdism. Anna is the hardest to place because she doesn't embody any one particular set of rigid philosophy, but essentially, she believes in authenticity, optimism, and the inherent goodness of others. Edmund, having been twisted by all the despair in his life, turns to nihilism and rejects morality and purpose; but he becomes tormented by the same meaningless existence that he uses as a shield. Elsa, who begins the story much the same as Edmund, comes into an absurdist mindset by the end: not needing purpose as a destination, but perhaps being able to find meaning in the search.

(Interesting to note is the bizarre mixture of nihilism and existentialism that Ed!Anna exhibits, along with the sadomasochistic tendencies. Delving into her mind could be another chapter of discussion.)

All the philosophical standpoints are a backdrop for the central theme of identity.

Tempest is primarily a self-versus-self story, and can be described as a journey where Elsa rediscovers her identity. Elsa is paralleled and opposed by Edmund, similar in their background and their desperate need for validation, even the way they think; but they are foil characters, because despite all their similarities, Elsa manages to reach self-acceptance, while Edmund arguably never does.

Both of them created reliquaries---the ultimate act of self-denial, the refusal to be vulnerable, and the rejection of memory. In that way, you can consider the reliquary to be a nihilist act. Albert Camus and Ayn Rand spoke of nihilism as defeatism, and also as an inherently hypocritical philosophy, because true nihilists would commit suicide; Elsa and Edmund, therefore, revile life but also crave completion.

Masks are a common symbol for their self-denial. Elsa has the metaphorical mask of her power, her throne, and Edmund has the physical mask that conceals his face behind the Sorcerer persona. Also related are the themes of fear and dichotomy, where both these characters want to feel, but also fear the vulnerability. Both of them are extremists. Elsa recognizes facets of her personality as distinct halves: the one who wields power, and the one who is weak; the angel with blood on her hands, and the dragon that loves Anna. Which part of her personality is real? All of it. It's that lesson she learns.

Recovery is never easy, though. Elsa slips backward just as often as she makes progress. She and Edmund share the same dilemma, that both of them look to the wrong reasons, and the wrong methods. Elsa wants to feel again, but much of her motivation is purely for Anna; Edmund attempts to assimilate feelings and experiences from others, and he eventually sets his sight on Anna too. It's paradoxical, that in wanting to be whole, they lessen themselves and glorify someone else. Both of them believe that they are imperfect, and that to be whole, they have to further erase their identity and emulate others.

And Anna, despite having the best of intentions, does what many people do when trying to help. She tries to be everything that Elsa needs to be happy, not realizing that Elsa needs to stand on her own. Emotional manipulation and dependency are also prominent themes, largely shown through Markus and, unfortunately, Anna. Markus consciously manipulates Elsa, making her dependent on his approval, but Anna actually does much the same thing. Of course she doesn't mean to, but her presence alone made Elsa dependent, something Edmund takes advantage of by using Anna, and love, as a weapon.

Elsa eventually learns from _Edmund_ that she has to let go, and that letting go doesn't mean forcing away all emotion so she'll never be vulnerable again. It means accepting vulnerability, and accepting all the pain of the past as something that shaped you, but doesn't need to define you. At one point, she thought she would regain her heart and be able to feel again, but the truth is---Elsa learns to feel again, and her heart returns. She accepts every facet of it, even the potential for loss, and grows as a person.

Much of that new mindset is enumerated in Chapters 48 to 50---I'll move on.

Anna has an interesting character arc. At the beginning, Anna is primarily a passive character. She learns independence after being forced to leave Agdar's protection, and gain greater and greater agency, in contrast to the passivity that Elsa exhibits. Anna makes it her mission to help Elsa, and she appears almost perfect; but just like how Elsa and Edmund are foils, Anna has a foil in Saul. Most people will readily see the selfishness that Saul exhibits, but like Elsa, many readers are blinded by Anna's good intentions. Saul loved the idea of love, and the ideal that Elsa represented in his mind; Anna, likewise, loved particular facets of Elsa, and denied the rest. Really, the only line between them was intent.

One thing that Anna has to learn, though, is not to allow her agency---which is an admirable thing---to mask another person. (Another interesting note is that _Edmund_ had much more agency than Elsa. Even if his methods were outright despicable, he was always trying, and he was much more self-aware up until his last moment of psychosis. Agency is a good thing, but as with many other qualities, can be turned destructive.) Until their separation, not even Anna realizes that she tries to change Elsa, and that subconscious desire leads to her possession. Anna doesn't have to be perfect, though, and she learns:

Nobody has to be perfect.

**One last extra scene for those of you who made it this far!**

* * *

It was a beautiful sight.

Anna didn't know where she was, but the thought didn't concern her as much as it should have. She didn't even remember where she had been, or what she had been doing before. It didn't seem to matter now. She had simply opened her eyes to an unbroken plain of snow, pure and undisturbed. None fell from the skies, leaving only a perfect expanse that went on as far as the eye could see. As she rose to her feet, though, the landscape shifted. Where there had been nothing there now stood a castle, tall, proud, and she stood not in the open, but within the courtyard.

She did not question.

Anna crossed to the center of the courtyard and sat at the edge of the fountain there, running her hands through the clear water held in its basin. It was not cold. She allowed the water to settle, and looked down into her reflection. Her face was as it had been, unburdened, unlined, eyes wide with wonder and lips set into a content smile. A very long time passed while she stayed there, staring and blinking at herself, for this was a face she barely recognized but missed dearly.

All at once, though, there was rain.

Anna raised her head. She had not noticed when, but the white sky was now grey with stormclouds and sudden wind whipped the rain into frenzy. Something was wrong about the rain. As droplets struck her cheek, she could smell it; the familiar tang of copper… the taste of blood. Anna sprang to her feet and rubbed at her skin, but the rain, the blackened blood, clung to her hands and marred her face. It only smeared across her skin like great tracts of tar and oil. She would never be able to get it off.

Even the fountain now came to life, its tranquil waters dyed black and the sludge overflowing. Anna stumbled away with a cry, tripping over the hem of her cloak. She struck the snow on her back, raised her hands to shield her face from the rain. Through her blurring vision, she saw _something_ forming from the dark waters, vaguely human, hands grasping for her legs, blind eyes peering into her mind.

**_Have you forgotten me?_**

Anna pushed off the ground and ran for the castle.

She did not know these hallways but moved on instinct alone, each step guided by sudden decision that was not hers. She could hardly breathe. Around the corridor she ran, then down the long hall, hearing a quiet moan and the patter of feet following behind. She did not dare look back. Dark liquid dripped down from the ceiling with a rhythmic thud like a heartbeat, gushed through the walls and climbed, always, always following. Anna kept running. She didn't dare stop.

Doors disappeared. She could not escape. Paths vanished. Anna kept running where she could, head spinning with breathless terror and eyes flitting to and fro for the next route. Until there was only one hallway left, and she saw one last door at its end. She had no choice. She ran.

**_Where are you going?_**

She went through the door.

Slammed it shut.

Anna told herself that she was safe here, and it was true that all the motion ceased. All the world calmed. Everything was as still as it had been at the beginning. There was no light in this room, only comforting night, so black that she could see nothing but the unbroken darkness. Anna released a shuddering breath, sliding down against the closed door. She was safe. Wherever this was, she was safe.

And then the candles lit, one by one, and the aisles were illuminated, so that Anna saw the intertwined angel and dragon at the end of the hall and knew exactly where she was.

It was the chapel.

She was not alone.

**_Do you remember me now?_**

An armored figure was kneeling at the base of the statue, and he, or she, or it, stood and turned around. On their face was the skull-mask, painted with the cross of blood, and they beckoned with one hand.

**_Come here… Anna._**

She did.

She could not disobey.

Shadows spread from the figure's feet and diffused outwards, wrapping around them both, searing her skin with its dark warmth. Sparks flickered through the air, blinking like stars before winking out, leaving the acrid stench of burning hair. A dark heart pulsed in the whirlwind. She could see the diseased _thing_ beating, bloating outwards and contracting, again, again; could hear the labored breath gasping its throes, again, again. Anna stood paralyzed when the figure took off their mask, slowly, deliberately. She knew that face just as she knew that voice, cruel and saturated with saccharine delight.

Her own.

**_Anna is _**my**_ name._**

She, the Other-Anna, dissolved into the shadows too. It lunged for her just as the web constricted, seizing her arms and legs and dragging her off the ground. Her limbs were yanked back until the flesh tore; her entire body was bent so far that her spine almost snapped. Darkness flooded over her face, bled into her eyes, her nose, her mouth. She tried to scream and it only rushed down her throat, muffling her voice and choking in her lungs. Anna remembered this, remembered that vile touch which infiltrated her body and mind. It was happening again. She was going to lose control again---

Anna woke.

She jolted upward, breathing harsh and uneven, hands locked tight around her blankets. It was… just a dream. Elsa was still asleep at her side. They were on their voyage. Anna swallowed her retch, fighting the urge to vomit. It had been a dream. She still did not dare close her eyes, lest she return to that place. After an eternity of the gentle rocking of the waves, listening to the rhythm of Elsa breathing, Anna allowed herself to relax her grip. Just a dream. Just a dream. Just-

There were burn marks on the blankets.

Slowly, Anna turned over one shaking hand. Wisps of dark flame flickered in her palm, and bled away into nothing.

**_I am always here._**
