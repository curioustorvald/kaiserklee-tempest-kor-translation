**Chapter 44: God Hath Given You One Face**

Anna was bound to the throne, arms and legs shackled to the white stone by oscillating bands of shadow. She thought the flames would hurt, but instead, where the shackles touched there was no feeling at all. She could not feel the shackles, and it was almost worse than pain. She felt as though her limbs had all been detached from her body, leaving her drifting helplessly.

"You have nothing to fear from me," Markus said. "If Elsa comes, no harm will come to you."

"You – are – insane." Anna struggled to move, but the numbing effect of the shadows only spread. It was horrible. It was like she was being unmade, and she wondered, with a touch of panic, what would happen if it spread to her head. "What do you even want from Elsa? What did you do to her?"

Markus walked away, and Anna could see his clenched hands shaking behind his back. She watched as he relentlessly paced through the throne room, back and forth, each time increasing his speed, his coattails flapping at his feet without cease. Finally, at the other end of the room, he whirled around. Storming toward her and seizing her shirt, Markus came so close that Anna could see the manic light of his eyes. It glowed so brightly that blue was _all_ she could see.

"I loved my daughter more than anything," Markus said, half-hunched and snarling like an animal. "But she chose you, and betrayed me. If not for you, none of this would be happening!"

"If you had never manipulated her at all, none of this would be happening," Anna retorted.

Markus shoved her away so that she smashed against the back of the throne. But he seemed to have calmed. Studying her with a calculating gaze that Anna would have preferred to avoid, he said, "You have spirit. I can see why Elsa would place such value on you."

"Thanks, but I don't need any compliments from you."

"Why do you hate me so?" Markus asked.

It was amazing that he sounded genuinely curious. Anna was speechless at the audacity, but once she found her voice again, she launched into a tirade.

"I'm not even sure yet what you did to Elsa, but I know it can't be anything good," Anna said, tempted to try to spit at the man. "And Gustaf and Edmund? You are a sick, twisted man to do that to your family."

"What do you know about them?" Markus asked sharply.

"I know that you made Gustaf make a reliquary, just like you did to Elsa," Anna snapped. But contrary to the anger she expected from him, Markus only looked puzzled. She doubted he was faking. Markus had no need to trick her now. "And Edmund? I know that he's your grandson. You tore their family apart."

At the mention of Edmund, Markus sharpened his gaze, practically boring holes into her head with his eyes. "How do you know about that? Who else knows? Does Edmund–?"

Markus was interrupted by a rumble from outside.

"Elsa is here," Markus said, looking out as though he could see her approach. "As soon as I have the complete Mirror under control, everything will be mine. Nothing else matters now."

"You're a monster," Anna spat. "Elsa's going to take you down."

"Oh, I have no doubt that she will try; I taught her well." Markus curled his lip. "You are more foolish than I believed, to think of her as any more innocent than myself. Do you know how we collect the shards? Do you realize how many are dead?"

Maybe even the trolls. Pabbie. Bulda. All the other trolls who had welcomed her and tried their best to help. Were they gone? Anna couldn't even imagine. Had Elsa really killed them? But impossible as it was to imagine the loss of the trolls who were so full of life, she _could_ see Elsa killing to fulfill her mission.

"I don't think of her as innocent," Anna said.

Markus raised an eyebrow.

"But only because _you_ twisted her mind and never let her think for herself," Anna said, once again straining to lean forward. For the first time in her life, she found herself consciously wanting to reach out and cause harm to this selfish, brutish man. "You never gave her a chance to be anything else."

"More excuses?"

"I don't know what she's going to choose in the future," Anna said. "But I know that she has a choice. If you think she's only ever going to be a killing machine, then you don't know her half as well as me."

"…Wait and see," Markus said. "She will always be more mine than yours."

With those last words he vanished, and Anna was left there to wait.

_She belongs to no one._

* * *

Elsa marched through the gates of the Southern Isles Castle, pulverizing them with a wave of snow that bent the metal into an unrecognizable shape. She could barely control the power flooding through her veins, the power that responded to her rage and itched to unleash destruction. She wanted to tear the castle down, and only the thought that Anna was inside stopped her from doing so.

Uncaring that Kristoff had trouble matching her pace, Elsa sped towards the doors and ripped them open, sending the wooden frame flying into the Great Hall.

She thought she would need to search. She thought Anna would be hidden somewhere in the castle, but the first sight that welcomed her was Anna straight down the corridor and in the throne room. Elsa ran down the hall, each step bringing her closer to the redhead. With every step, the storm swept into the castle, and ice bled over the carpet, froze over on the chandeliers. Nothing impeded her approach.

"Elsa!" Anna yelled. "Don't worry about me! Just don't give him what he wants–!"

Anna's head snapped back as she was forced to quiet. Elsa couldn't see Markus anywhere, but she recognized that it was his magic which bound Anna to the throne. She prepared to blast off the shackles, but before she could get close, shadows burst from the floor and stretched from wall to wall. She could still see Anna behind its opaque surface, eyes wide and breathing harshly.

"Just hang on, Anna. I'll get you out of this," Elsa said, preparing to shatter the barrier.

"You won't manage it fast enough."

At the sound of Markus' voice reverberating through the throne room, Elsa looked up at the ceiling. Still not here; Markus was only projecting his voice from somewhere else, and she could guess exactly where.

"Let her go!" Elsa yelled. "Are you so afraid that you'll take a hostage?"

"I know your power better than anyone, and I know that it eclipses my own. It would be foolish of me to make demands of you without insurance."

Before Elsa could react, black flames erupted into existence on the other side of the wall. Spreading across the floor like the stone had been doused in oil, the blaze crawled closer and closer to Anna.

Elsa immediately struck the wall, but the barrier only rippled as it absorbed her magic. She couldn't afford to use anything more powerful. She could break the barrier with lightning, but that would only exacerbate the flames. Elsa thought she would be driven mad at the sight of the first embers licking at Anna's feet, at the silent scream that Anna could only convey through her eyes.

"What do you want?" Elsa demanded.

"Give me the Mirror shard," Markus said.

Anna furiously shook her head until she was once again slammed backwards, but Elsa didn't even need to think. Summoning the shard, she let it hover upwards and toward Markus, until the glass winked away with a flash of light. But even after, the fires never weakened. Elsa slammed her hands into the wall helplessly as Anna's boots were consumed, and as if sensing weakness, the flames intensified. Anna threw her head back, eyes screwed shut, as the acrid smell of burning flesh assaulted Elsa's senses.

"Markus!" Elsa screamed. "I've given you what you want! Let Anna go!"

"I have one more request to make," Markus said, and she could practically hear the cold smile in his voice. "You will join me for one final reunion."

"Fine! Just stop this right now!"

At once, the flames vanished as though they had never been. Elsa summoned lightning and shattered the wall, passing through even before the pieces had fallen to the floor. Ripping the shackles off Anna's wrists and ankles with one powerful swing of her hand, Elsa swept the girl in her arms. Anna smiled blearily, but even dazed, her smile was as beautiful as always. Elsa finally allowed herself to smile back, relieved beyond words that Anna was unharmed. She could have never forgiven herself otherwise.

"I-I am so sorry for everything," Elsa said.

"No, I'm sorry," Anna said.

Elsa shook her head. "You were always right about Markus. I was blind. I should have listened to you."

"I'm not always right," Anna murmured. "I was wrong about a lot of things. I made you a lot of promises that I couldn't keep."

"When you were outside the tent, and I knew you were there…I was so happy," Elsa said. "Even after everything, you still won't give up on me. I don't know how I can ever thank you enough. I'm sorry."

Elsa vaguely realized this was the first time they had spoken since Arendelle. She had never imagined their reunion like this, on the cusp of battle against Markus; but despite the circumstance, everything felt right between them. Elsa was relieved. It was as though they had never been apart. Or, rather, they had been apart and came together again somehow better than they were before.

Anna cupped her face, and Elsa leaned into the touch. "Stop saying that you're sorry. You have nothing to be sorry for, especially not when we've come so far now. We…can make it work. We'll keep trying."

"Yes," Elsa said, smiling.

"And when we have some more time," Anna said, grinning, "I can give you my big speech all over again. I still need to apologize properly, and you are going to hear it this time."

Before Elsa had time to ask what Anna could possibly have to be sorry for, Kristoff arrived. While Anna shouted about being glad to see him, Elsa deposited the redhead into Kristoff's arms.

"Anna, I'm going to numb the burns. Just distract yourself and talk to him," Elsa said. Once Anna nodded and began tentatively to talk, she allowed the cold to envelop her hand. It had been a long time since she did anything with such finesse. Since her separation from Anna. Elsa gently laid her hand over Anna's feet, hurting as badly at the sight of reddened and blistered skin as if she were the one burned.

"I'm glad you're all right," Anna said, and Kristoff shrugged, rubbing the back of his neck.

"Sorry I was basically useless."

"Well, I don't think you – were!" Anna winced, and Elsa calmed her magic as best she could. "S-So, uhh, I haven't seen Sven around lately."

"Oh, yeah." Kristoff groaned. "We left him in Arendelle. Dammit, Elsa."

"I barely had time to let you tag along, let alone a reindeer."

Having done as much as she could for her wounds, Elsa drew away from Anna. After so long apart, she wished they could have more time together and she longed to stay here, stay with Anna; but right now, the pressing matter was Markus. If this wasn't resolved, she would never be able to find solace.

"Anna, I'm sorry you had to get involved in this." Elsa tilted her head upwards, knowing that Markus was still waiting up above. "If not for me, then you would still be safely at home. But…I'm going to fix all this."

"…You're going to meet him."

"Whatever Markus is planning, he needs to be stopped."

Anna stared into her eyes, probing glance reflecting an understanding of so much more than what Elsa managed to say. Elsa knew that her reasons for stopping Markus were not so noble as she made them sound. Markus was mad, but Elsa only wanted the truth. She wanted to hear from him exactly what had transpired all those years ago. She wanted – needed – confirmation of what she already knew.

"Stay safe," Anna murmured.

"I promise I'll come back. And then…we can start over," Elsa said. She turned to Kristoff. "Watch over Anna for me. Get her someplace safe, and don't look back."

Elsa spared no more time. As she strode out the throne room and up the stairs leading to the balcony level, all her thoughts were on Markus. As she began to climb up the tower to where he awaited, anger built in the pit of her stomach. Elsa took the stairs one, then two, then three at a time, her magic roiling beneath her skin and filling her senses with the sharpest cold.

She hated Markus so violently that it made her sick. She could almost feel a flush of heat before the sick chill washed over her again, bringing with it the promise of revenge. But by the time she reached the top of the staircase, the relentless anger was gone, and in its place was the sting of betrayal. No matter how hard she tried to hold onto hate, she only felt hurt. It was a strange sensation. Murder had always been a thing preceded by cold calculation, or unfettered rage.

Never had she been afraid.

Elsa stepped into the chamber and saw Markus at the far end of the tower's circumference, on the border of the larger circle that encompassed the carved runes on the floor. Standing there unarmored, unarmed, Markus still looked like the benevolent father that she remembered. Behind him was the Mirror, humming with song that Elsa had heard only from the snow. Nearly completed with the addition of the Arendellian shard, only the tiniest cracks speckled its otherwise pristine surface.

Save for a perfectly symmetrical gap in the middle, shaped in the form of a six-pointed snowflake.

"Elsa," Markus said, once he saw her approach. "Will you let me speak?"

"I will listen," Elsa said.

She thought she saw him breathe a sigh of relief.

"Let me tell you the story of the Southern Isles."

"A long time ago, there were gods." Markus' voice echoed, carried through the chamber walls. "Men and women who transcended their mortal trappings, with the power of the Mirror at their command. They existed in a state of infinite majesty, glorious immortals who shaped the world around them."

Elsa cautiously stepped closer to him, glimpsing, at long last, the reason behind his madness.

"Until the Mirror was shattered, and those rulers were banished from their home. Stripped of their power and their dignity, they were sent away to wander the lonely corners of the world. Arendelle was lost and became a home to the weak, and the strong founded a new kingdom upon the ashes of their exile. We, the royal lineage of the Southern Isles, are their descendants."

She stepped closer still. As soon as Elsa touched one of the lines etched on the floor, the runes glowed with white light that flooded the carving like a liquid, until the entire carving shone.

"And you are one of us, Elsa."

Markus sounded so earnest that it frightened her a little.

"How does any of this concern me?" Elsa asked.

"Do you still not see?"

Markus gestured with a wild motion towards the gap in the Mirror, the snowflake insignia missing from the center, and then jerked his head upwards. Elsa followed his gaze to her reliquary, the six-pointed snowflake that had been torn from her heart.

"Your heart is the last piece of the Mirror. You _are_ the Mirror reincarnated."

Now Markus was the one to step closer, and he outstretched his hand.

"Listen to me, Elsa. It was always my mandate to avenge the indignities of my ancestors. Imagine my surprise when the one shard that we still possessed led me to you. It was then that I realized – I was destined to set you on the path. I was to be your guide. You are the one meant to restore the Mirror to its glory, and together, we can do so much. Anything we desire, Elsa. Anything can be ours."

It was tempting.

It really was tempting to just take his hand.

"If you really meant for us to work together…" Elsa smiled. She would have fallen for this, once. She would have believed him like a fool. "Why did you have me carve out my heart?"

It was just for a brief moment, but the ugliness that came over Markus' features could not be masked. Elsa saw the madness clearly. Slowly, Markus withdrew his hand.

"So you have chosen to disregard everything I have done for you."

"What _have_ you done for me?"

"Yes, I have taken from you," Markus admitted. "But I have also given you so much more. Is it not a fitting trade, your life of royalty? And all of this could be yours. All of this power, this control–!"

"How could you bear my trust and love all these years?"

Elsa nearly shook, with anger, with remorse, with guilt. She clenched her hand tight at her side, fingernails digging into her palms. She couldn't bear the thought that she had been so easily deceived. She had been so blind. All these years, she had sought comfort from the man who had ruined her family.

"Tell me the truth," Elsa said. "What did you do?"

"But _you_ were the one to kill them."

"I am asking you – what – you – did."

She punctuated each word harshly.

It was only because of Markus that she had done it.

"…Hate cannot be taught. It must be learned." Markus laughed uproariously, throwing his head back and barking out guttural, scathing laughs. "Do you think your parents were really free of blame?"

"It was–"

"I did nothing that was not already there," Markus hissed. "I changed part of your memories, but false memories would never be enough. You needed to _feel_ the pain for yourself, pain that you learned when your parents cast you into the fire. They were under spell, but you already know how this magic works, this magic derived from the Mirror's power. Desire, Elsa. Your parents _never_ accepted you, or they would never have been capable of their savagery!"

There was a moment of silence between them, when even the humming of the Mirror seemed to quiet.

"I am the only one who has ever fully accepted you," Markus said. "I _need_ you, Elsa."

"Is that why you were capable of tearing me away from my family?" Elsa knelt and laid her hand over the glowing stone. Grudgingly, she marveled at the complexity of the runes. It was an ingenuous working that must have taken years and years to refine. "What desire do _you_ have?"

Markus said nothing.

She knew he wasn't telling the whole truth.

"Whatever these runes are for, anyone can make use of them. You always intended to do this without me." Elsa rose, and the light spiked in response before settling again. "What now, Markus? What is the point of all this?"

His face contorted briefly with rage, or hate, or some other emotion that he could not fully control.

"It's true," Markus said. "I had hoped it would not come to this, but this magic will allow me to wrest control of your heart. I had hoped you would cooperate, Elsa."

"Even after what you have done to me, Markus?"

"…You are no longer needed. If you will not aid me willingly, then you are useless. Worse than useless! You are both unworthy and ungrateful of the power bestowed upon you."

Markus spun around and placed his hand over the Mirror, fingers clenched over its surface. It levitated out its frame and drifted to the spot where Markus' tomb had once been, where the floor had been carved out into a circular indentation. Locking into place, the Mirror rested there now.

"The Mirror is powerful enough now to complete itself by its own will," Markus said. "All the shards will return to its call, torn from the hearts of men. And after I take your heart, and force my will upon it…I will become a god."

Her heart shone bright above them like a star illuminating the night sky, the darkness that pervaded this chamber which had once been hers. Markus turned, slowly, and Elsa met his stare. It was cruel and pitiless, and burned away the last shreds of doubt that she had harbored.

Elsa prepared herself to sever this last bond she had with her father and mentor.

* * *

Another tremor shook the castle.

"We should get out of here," Kristoff said.

Anna felt her stomach plummet when Kristoff broke into a dead run, carrying her within his arms. But strangely, once they reached the Great Hall, Kristoff did not run out the doors. Instead, he dashed to the side and kicked down the door to the princes' wing, careening backwards just a little from the force. Steadying himself quickly, Kristoff set off down the hall.

"Where are you–?"

"Edmund is still here," Kristoff said, rounding the corner just as a ponderous roar sounded above their heads. Another tremor rocked through the castle, so strongly this time that the paintings fell. Even the potted plants toppled over, shattering into bits of porcelain.

"Whose bright idea was it to leave him here?" Anna exclaimed, holding her hand over her head as dust began to fall from the cracking ceiling. "Seriously, why would everyone leave _but_ Edmund?"

Her question was answered once Kristoff burst through Edmund's door, and Anna saw the normally lively prince sitting in bed, face pale and sickly. She almost didn't recognize him. When he saw them, though, he still smiled. It didn't quite reach his eyes, whose color had dulled somewhat, fogged by a cold, glassy haze. Edmund eased himself out of bed, seemingly undisturbed by the commotion.

"Good to see you again, Anna," Edmund said, his voice carrying a quiet, measured quality it had not possessed before. "You are exactly the person I wanted to see."

"A-Are you all right?"

"Never been better, actually."

Strangely, Edmund sounded sincere, and hopeful, despite his illness taking an obvious toll. Seeing him hobble towards them, looking so reduced, she couldn't imagine how he was still optimistic.

"Are we leaving?" Edmund asked.

"O-Oh!" Anna nodded. "Yeah, we should."

Anna jumped out of Kristoff's arms, wincing just a little at the pain in her feet.

"Carry Edmund instead," Anna said, ignoring Kristoff's protest. She snatched up a pair of shoes from Edmund's collection and shoved them on. "I'm fine, Elsa did a good job. I barely feel the pain anymore."

"Hey, I'm all right too," Edmund said, and Kristoff groaned. "I can walk. It's faster this way."

"Look, Edmund–"

"I know my limits well," Edmund said.

Before Anna or Kristoff could argue, Edmund left the room. His pace was just as fast as Kristoff, surprising for someone still recovering from illness; but his _movements_ were what truly surprised Anna, fluid movements filled with some frenetic energy. She followed, and together, the three of them left the wing and entered the Great Hall again, leaving through the main doors to the courtyard.

Outside, Anna craned her neck to look upwards. High above them, the uppermost spires of the castle were wreathed in unnatural dark clouds, thick billows that continuously circled the tower and obscured it from view. As she watched, the sky was briefly illuminated by a burst of white light, followed immediately by another tremor and a distant sound like a thunderclap.

"Anna! We need to go," Kristoff said.

She shook her head and kept going, joining Kristoff and Edmund ahead at the castle gates. Just before they could pass through, a barrier manifested around the castle walls. There was no forewarning of its appearance. One moment the skies had been clear, and the next, a shimmering, gold-tinted barrier erupted into existence around the entire castle grounds, diamond-shaped and impregnable. It was transparent – tantalizing them with the outside world.

"What the hell is happening?" Kristoff said, open-mouthed.

All around them, the skies were filled with pockets of spiraling air, diagonal rifts with jagged edges, as though the air had been torn like a thick, fibrous cloth. It first vibrated, and then shook wildly, distorted, before finally snapping into the vortexes they saw now. Everywhere they touched, the elements fluctuated without reason; Anna saw the stone walls sag like melting candle wax, the falling snow boil into water that hung suspended, shimmering a rainbow of colors, before falling as rain. Even the light that struck the vortexes refracted without order, casting shadows where they ought not to be.

"It's the Mirror at work," Edmund said suddenly. "It's unstable this close to completion, and seeking equilibrium. Look. All reality is being warped. All the elements are thrown into chaos."

Edmund sounded remarkably blasé about the insanity around them. If Anna didn't know better she would have thought he was commenting on sunny weather with clear skies.

"How do you even…know that?" Anna asked.

"Does it matter right now?" Kristoff said, pointing at the castle gates that were undulating wildly. "We can't get through here. It's not even safe outside!"

"We should head back inside," Edmund said.

Anna would have preferred braving the outside, but Edmund had a point. Even now, the ground rippled as though something were traveling underneath. Kristoff grabbed her arm and led her back inside, where everything had become warped. Ink melted and bled down the canvases of the paintings, their contents distorted into faceless portraits and twisted landscapes. Above, the crystal drops of the chandelier turned into unending rain that fell upon a single spot. Even the staircase had been blocked.

"Follow me," Edmund said, taking the lead and bringing them left.

But almost everywhere they went, they encountered roadblocks. Whether it was the floor suddenly forming a wall, or the walls closing in on them, the castle itself seemed hostile to their escape. And the crowd of people too, all the fleeing servants who had no idea what was happening. It was a rush of people like she had never seen. Anna saw the mob trample some of their own coworkers underfoot, and even when she stopped to help, they only brushed her off and continued running.

"Look, we can all work together and–!"

"There's no use," Edmund said, pulling her back while Kristoff warded off the crowd. "When it comes down to it, everybody looks after themselves."

She wished she could argue, but another mob raced down the corridor and Anna had to fight through the tangle of limbs. One maid rushed past, striking Edmund in the chest so heavily that he crumpled to the floor coughing. Kristoff quickly stooped and picked him up.

"Pretty sure it's faster _this_ way now," Kristoff said.

"…Thank you," Edmund murmured.

"Where exactly are we trying to go?" Anna asked.

"I think the chapel will be safe. It's always had magic. Hopefully it'll be enough to protect us."

It was the best plan they had for now. With one problem – Anna knew the path to the chapel, and it had already been sealed off by something that resembled dry ice. But Anna remembered there was a second way, and she recognized this path that Edmund was taking them.

"We're taking the hidden entrance," Anna said, and Edmund nodded.

"Just keep giving me directions," Kristoff said.

They forged on, dodging the strange phenomenon that came to life. Once they passed Gustaf's room, though, their path seemed to clear up. Anna held her breath as the three of them raced down the twisting corridor that led to the blank wall, each step bringing them closer and closer to safety. Her feet pounded in time with the beat of her heart against her chest. Behind them, Anna could hear the air tearing apart. But they were close now. Just another corner, surely…

"We made it!" Anna shouted.

Safety was just in sight when it happened.

Kristoff ground to a halt and Anna looked back, mouth opening in a small gasp when she saw the air distorting all around him. Just behind him was a growing vortex sucking in everything around itself, even bending the light so that there grew an inky darkness within its confines. Kristoff pushed against the suction with all his strength, actually managing to advance a little even as the skin of his face seemed to pull inwards. In his arms, Edmund narrowed his eyes, not with fear, but with cold resolve.

"Kristoff!" Anna cast her gaze about, looking for anything she could use to pull Kristoff and Edmund back, anything at all, but her thoughts were scattered with panic. Nothing. Everything was just a mess of ruined rubble. "Hang on, I've got you guys. Just wait one more second, I swear I'll get you out of there–"

Edmund raised his head, hand outstretched to do _something_, but at that moment Kristoff threw him forward. Anna didn't react in time. Edmund crashed into her and the two of them sprawled to the floor, sliding backwards just enough to hit the wall that would lead to the chapel.

"What are you…?" Edmund began.

"Don't worry about me," Kristoff said, reaching out one last time. "Just keep each other safe!"

"Wait–!"

But Anna was too late.

Kristoff was drawn away into the rift.

His body sloughed into liquid streams that spiraled through the vortex, until nothing remained.

Anna stared at the spot where Kristoff had been, paralyzed by horror and shock. She could hardly comprehend what had just happened. One moment he had been standing right there, as strong as always, always reliable, and the next – Kristoff was gone. She would never see him again.

Edmund looked no less shocked, but in a different way. It was a questioning gaze, the expression of someone confused and puzzling over an enigma. He was frowning, eyes narrowed in consternation as though he couldn't understand why Kristoff had done what he had.

"…We need to keep going," Edmund said blankly.

Anna honestly didn't think he sounded like he cared.

Placing his hand over the wall, Edmund opened the passageway. Only when Anna saw his outstretched hand did she remember to keep moving. Her limbs felt burdened by lead. She wanted to just collapse, and without Edmund, she likely would have done just that. Following him through the dark passage that had no more of the rifts, they eventually stepped through the threshold and into the chapel.

It was the first time Anna had been here since the capturing of the Sorcerer.

She remembered it well.

Already the candles were all lighted, as though for vigil, and their faint orange glow cast flickering silhouettes on the walls. At the front of the chapel, the destroyed altar had been replaced with a winged angel, sword drawn for battle. But not all had been repaired. Even now, the stained windowpane that hid the passageway was still broken, letting the two of them step through unhindered; Anna remembered the fear and anticipation as she walked through the last time, unknowing of just who she would find. Stepping through here again, and seeing Edmund, she felt the strangest sense of déjà vu.

Anna couldn't shake an odd chill that had settled into her bones.

"I can't believe Kristoff is gone," Anna mumbled.

"…Why did he do that?"

She glanced over to see Edmund still looking as puzzled as before. With his eyebrows drawn together and his lips set into a frown, he looked like he was vexed over a particularly elusive mystery.

"Because he wanted to save you," Anna said.

"Yes, but…I don't understand why. It doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't he try to save himself instead? What did he have to gain from trying to help me?"

"There…wasn't a reason," Anna said. "Kristoff just cared about the two of us."

Edmund grew silent.

Anna had seen the smile on Kristoff's face right before he disappeared into the vortex. Kristoff had been glad he could save them both. She could mope here all day, or she could honor his memory the way he would have wanted. It still hurt, now, but she would have time later to grieve. She couldn't let herself break down here. Not until all this was settled.

"What do we do now?" Anna said, thinking aloud. "It's safe here, but there has to be something we can do for all those people outside. We need to get them to safety–"

"There's nothing more to be done."

Anna watched as Edmund walked to the altar and fell to his knees. Hands clasped together at his chest, and lips mouthing a prayer in silence, he stared unblinkingly at the angel.

"Are you praying for Kristoff?" Anna asked.

"Not just him. Alvard, Tobias, Reid, Kristoff," Edmund recited, pausing so subtly on the next name that it was almost imperceptible. "And Gustaf. Everyone who has sacrificed themselves for me."

"What do you…mean?"

"Let me ask you something, Anna."

Edmund rose to his feet.

"Having learned all that you have learned…I want to know your thoughts."

Edmund bowed his head. Even from behind, Anna could see the tension straining his neck.

"What you think is right and wrong…are those things…right and wrong for everybody else, too? Whatever purpose you keep living for…are those things…real for everyone, or are they just an illusion? What you think is your true face…the face behind the mask…is that really…your true face?"

"I-I don't understand," Anna said. "I'm not wearing any mask."

"No, you never have, and you never will, because you...are Anna," Edmund said softly.

Edmund was scaring her more with every word. It was something in his voice, an unhinged edge that gave all his words an unsettling, whispery lilt. Because it was _too_ calm. It was the voice of someone who had nothing more to lose, someone who stood on the precipice and looked down into the abyss, and found even that was infinitely better than the hell to which he had been condemned.

"…I am so tired, Anna."

Anna took a step forward, but stopped when Edmund shook his head.

"Is something wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong. Soon, there will be nothing left to be wrong."

Anna watched Edmund carefully. His head was raised, now, tilted barely to one side as though he were pondering some great question.

"Because I've learned to have faith, Anna. There's something I need to tell you." Edmund took a deep breath and exhaled, slowly and laboriously, as though the very act pained him. "You've been great."

"Y-You too," Anna said.

She meant that. She couldn't imagine having come this far without Edmund. Edmund had always been a kindred soul, and her closest friend since she arrived at the Southern Isles; the friend who had encouraged her, given her guidance; the friend who had opened her eyes about Elsa, and even saved her life from Gustaf at the risk of his own. Anna couldn't think of another person she had trusted more.

But something about him scared her now.

"What's wrong, Edmund? Why are you telling me this?"

Edmund turned around, body disintegrating into shadows.

"I'm going to miss you."

His voice was the last thing Anna remembered before she blacked out, but she realized, just before the darkness overtook her senses, that she knew that voice.

It was the same one she had heard in her nightmares.

It was the voice of the man in the mask.

* * *

She could only see darkness.

Markus, having taken the hulking form of the shadow-beast, loomed nearly fifteen feet over her head and practically took up the entire chamber space. Elsa sped around the tower's circumference, eyes tracking every miniscule movement as Markus turned to follow. She whipped her arm forward, sending a wave of snow crashing towards the beast, but what should have been bone-crushing force only melted against the black flames that comprised its body.

Elsa raised her free arm, and an arc of ice bloomed just in time to block the shadowy fist that slammed down. Seeing the ice begin to crack, she sped around again, just before her wall shattered.

"How long are you going to run?" Markus bellowed.

Just long enough to summon her lightning.

Elsa came to an abrupt halt, adjusting the flow of her magic to launch her backwards as another blow crashed into the floor. Halfway through her flip, she twisted in midair and stabbed two fingers forward. Lightning rushed forward, devastating, surging with power enough to demolish the whole tower at once.

It changed course and was redirected to the floor, striking the runes and coursing along the grooves. Elsa watched as her lightning flooded into the Mirror and its surface rippled once, twice. Its humming grew louder, and the light that emanated from its surface glowed brighter before settling once more.

"Right now, so close to the end, your magic will only force the Mirror to activate and complete itself," Markus said. "How will you fight me when you cannot use your powers to their capacity?"

"You should know my power most of all," Elsa said. When next Markus struck, she rocketed forward and sliced through the limb with a blade of ice. Hearing the pained roar that erupted from the beast, her lips curled into a cold smile. "I won't need lightning for this."

Markus reeled back and the shadows coagulated, forming a new hand. With a thunderous rumble, Markus lashed out. Elsa threw herself away from the attack and his fist struck the walls, punching straight through, but Markus seemed to have no intention of stopping. Following Elsa's movements, he swung his arm around, crashing through the stone and ice as he went. By the time he was finished, he had carved out the entire wall, leaving only a jagged frame and sending rubble crashing down to earth.

Elsa dodged the falling debris as even the ceiling collapsed, weaving through the boulders and flinging them aside with her magic. Up above, the chandelier, and her reliquary, freely suspended itself.

Now open-aired, the tower was assaulted by the elements. So far above the ground, the winds were strong and battered with audible force. Within an instant, thick flurries of snow swept in, swirling and eddying in the erratic currents, but wherever they touched the runes, they burned away. Even through the snowstorm, Elsa could see the glow of the Mirror brightening further, until the light became its own miniature sun amidst the turmoil of white.

Elsa leapt atop a ramp and glided upwards, defying gravity as the ice spiraled around Markus. She never stopped moving even as the man threw bolt after bolt of dark flames, missing each time as she sped past. Even when Markus threw the fire into her path, she only stomped her foot, growing an arc that curved over the flames, and continued on. Higher and higher she went, her right arm outstretched so that she never stopped unleashing a cold wave on the shadowy beast. Her efforts were aided by the weather adding another layer of frost even as the last melted, again and again.

Before long, she had constructed a web of ice around Markus.

Ignoring the beast's shrill scream, she leapt off the end of the ramp, directly over the only opening of the entrapping web. Looking down, she could look past the gleaming yellow eyes, see through the shadows to where Markus hovered inside the monster that encased him. Their eyes were not so different. Cruel, gleaming with hate and fury. Markus opened his mouth in a silent scream just as Elsa clenched her fist, fighting past the growing pressure inside the web.

And the dome of ice compressed, crushing everything within its grasp.

Elsa landed and whirled around, flinging her arm to the side with a violent swing. With an earsplitting explosion the ice burst apart, sending shrapnel flying in all directions.

"Are you ready to fight me yourself?" Elsa asked.

None of the shadows remained. Markus lay face-down at the center of the circle, blood gushing from a gash on the top of his head. Slowly he pushed himself up, raising his head and revealing glowing blue eyes. His face was terrifying in its rage, all the more threatening despite his injury. Now he was a wounded beast. Blood ran down his forehead and into his eye, falling again as tears that painted one side of his face.

"How _dare_ you raise your hand to me, you ungrateful whelp," Markus hissed.

Shadows leapt forward, and the fury of Markus' magic was unlike anything Elsa had ever experienced. It was a soundless apocalypse that poured forth from his hands and crashed through even the barrier of her ice, enveloping her completely. Elsa could not see, hear, or even feel anything but darkness, the excruciating pull of his magic on all sides, threatening to tear her body apart and scatter her mind.

But Elsa was powerful too. Jaw clenched so that she would not scream, Elsa pushed back against the magic that was trying to infiltrate her very being. Her mouth opened in a long scream as she broke through the spell, and Markus' magic was shattered. Flung backwards like a ragdoll in a hurricane, Markus rolled along the floor and hit the side of the tower's skeletal frame.

Their combined magic was propelled outwards in a cataclysm of ice and shadow, and now many of the surrounding spires toppled to the ground. Even the castle shook with violent tremors; Elsa crouched to steady herself, taking just a brief moment to recover from the assault.

"Get up," Elsa said.

Time seemed to move slowly. Elsa formed a sword of ice in her hand and charged across the tower towards Markus. Stumbling to his feet, two blades sliding out from underneath his sleeves, Markus slashed viciously at the air, and from the tips of his swords, crescents of shadow flowed forth.

Elsa batted the spells aside, closing the distance between them within a second. Markus met her sword with his own blades, pivoting just slightly to redirect her forward. Elsa snarled and whipped her sword back around, slamming her sword down again and again, and again and again he parried. Until she swung too hard and overextended; Markus immediately capitalized, stabbing straight forward at her gut. Elsa twisted out of the way as best she could, but even still, the blade sliced deep into her side.

Now Markus was on the offensive, and she knew he relished every moment. Twin blades scissored for her head, and Elsa could only duck to avoid decapitation. She leapt back from the next attempt, only for Markus to bring one blade crashing down into hers, the force sending numbing jolts up her arm. Before she could react, Markus spun and kicked her wound, releasing another spray of blood.

Elsa fell backwards and landed on her back, barely able to see past the pain. Only reflex saved her when Markus slashed down and she rolled away, getting back on her feet just in time to block another flurry of slashes. Each of Markus' blades moved differently; Elsa knew he was ambidextrous, but not to this extent, that he could make attacks with both hands, in completely different directions at the same time, so that she was hard-pressed to block both. Finally, Markus flipped the sword in his right hand so that it was pommel-first and backhanded Elsa across the face.

She reeled back, mouth filling with blood.

"Worthless," Markus spat. "All of my time spent on you, wasted! You could have been so much more than this. I loved you, I would have given you everything, and you betrayed me!"

"_You_ betrayed _me!"_

Elsa ran forward as Markus scissored his swords, and she slammed her blade in between as fast as she could, swinging down with all her strength so that Markus was forced to separate them; and then she dropped her own blade, and threw herself forward with a furious scream.

Elsa forgot about magic entirely.

She just wanted Markus dead.

Elsa drove her entire body into Markus, sending them both crashing to the floor. Markus scrambled to rise, but Elsa seized his legs and forced him down again, ignoring one last desperate swing that struck her face and broke her jaw. She couldn't feel the pain past her rage. Markus struck at her savagely, kicking the wound in her side again and again, but Elsa ignored the blows and pinned him down.

"No! No, you–!"

Markus broke into a hacking cough, and Elsa very almost laughed. Here was the disease making its reappearance, at the perfect timing. She _reveled_ in the irony that Markus would die like this.

Elsa wrapped her hands around his throat, squeezing with all her strength. Her vision was blurred, either from pain or fury, but she could look down and see the fear on Markus' features. His eyes opened wide as they stared into her own, their matching color reflecting the same murderous storm.

"Go to hell," Elsa spat.

She tightened her hands around his neck, and slammed his head into the stone floor, again and again. Elsa felt Markus wrench his hand into her side, searing her skin with flames, but though she could smell her own burning flesh, she could not feel the pain. Markus opened his mouth soundlessly, eyes panicked, but his wry, brittle strength did him little good. Any other time, he could have overpowered her easily, but right then, fueled by adrenaline, Elsa refused to let go.

Shaking with effort, every thought consumed by the pain that wracked her body, Elsa hung on. She wanted to see his skull shatter, his spine snap–

With the last of his strength, Markus slammed his head into hers.

Elsa faltered, and Markus managed to force his hand between them, finding his way to the gash in her side. Shadows flooded _into_ the wound, and the paralyzing pain finally became too much, the red haze in her vision faded to white. Elsa's grip loosened. Markus kicked her off and she collapsed backwards, feeling her ruthless hatred scatter into the wind as her head struck the cold, hard floor.

She tried to rise. Her muscles screamed in protest, and her limbs rested heavy and unresponsive. She simply lay there, staring up at the snowflakes drifting down.

…They were beautiful.

…What had she been doing?

She could hear a horrible retching as Markus struggled to breathe, and she realized, vaguely, that he would not be getting up again. Elsa could feel her magic at work healing the wounds she had sustained. Her reliquary glowed, bringing her magic welling into her veins again. Her jawbone snapped into its proper position. Her burns mended. Even the gash in her side closed itself. Elsa rolled onto her front and slowly pushed herself up, watching as her father heaved, broken in both power and dignity.

"Markus," Elsa whispered.

Even after everything, this was the man who had raised her as his own. Regardless of his motives – Elsa knew that, somewhere deep inside, he had cared for her in his own way. It couldn't have all been faked. And she knew that she had cared for him. She _still_ did, despite everything, or else she would not have felt such cheated rage at the betrayal. Elsa walked closer and knelt down next to him.

"It's over, Markus."

"Not…over…yet…"

Elsa stepped away, shaking her head. She would let Markus live. She owed him that much, at least, and living out the rest of his days, unable to satiate his lust for control, would be punishment enough. She still needed to dismantle his spell, but after that, everything would be right again. It was over at last.

She heard footsteps from behind.

Anna was coming up the stairs, each step slow and deliberate, as though testing the staircase. Once she stepped into the ring, she looked around her surroundings, face carefully blank.

"I thought I told you to get away from here," Elsa said, but she smiled anyway.

"I couldn't let you have all the fun," Anna said, meeting her eyes with a soft smile. When she stepped closer though, her gaze settled on Markus and her lips turned into a frown. "Is he still…?"

"It's fine; Markus can't hurt anyone now." Elsa turned and walked to where the Mirror rested, summoning it from its confines so that it hovered upright in the air once more. It was so close to completion. She could complete it with only a thought, and then with its power, anything was possible.

"What are you going to do with that?" Anna asked.

"I'm going to scatter the pieces," Elsa said, though it pained her to think of breaking the artifact now that she knew their connection. It was better, though, that no one could abuse its powers.

"Are you…sure?"

"It's for the best."

Anna didn't say anything.

Elsa turned away. She focused on the Mirror and the almost hypnotizing glow of its surface, the white-etched kaleidoscope design spinning as the Mirror rotated slowly. Where once the shattered pieces had made it impossible to recognize the design, she could see it clearly now. Where the lines met in the center was meant to be her heart. Elsa looked up at the reliquary, at the snowflake, the vital portion of her heart that she had carved out. It would be so easy to just use the Mirror and fix herself.

But, Elsa thought, she didn't need the Mirror anymore.

She had Anna.

"I think it's really admirable that you're doing this," Anna murmured. Elsa heard her walk closer, laying one hand over her shoulder from behind. "Really, I do. It has to take a lot of strength."

"…Thank you, Anna."

Elsa summoned her power once more, preparing to scatter the shards. She would send them to the ends of the earth, where no one could assemble them again. Elsa raised her hand, but at that moment, her attention was drawn to Markus. Where he lay on the floor just a few feet ahead, he raised his hand. Not to tell her to stop. Not to try to strike her down. Not, even, to do anything for himself just this once.

It was a warning.

But it came too late.

Elsa felt a cold blade slide into her back, neatly passing between the vertebrae of her spine.

It was just a brief instance of pain, but also the worst pain she had ever felt. It was unadulterated agony that jolted through her entire back, then throughout her whole body, until all feeling went away. Elsa would have fallen if not for the strong grip now curling around her shoulders, and then she realized the pain was still there. It wasn't physical. She felt it where her heart had once rested, felt a breathless, reasonless horror at the realization that only one person could have done this.

Anna leaned in and grinned.

"Are you afraid...Sis?"
