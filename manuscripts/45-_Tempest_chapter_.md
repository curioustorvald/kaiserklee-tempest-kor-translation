**Chapter 45: Either Victory, Or Else A Grave**

Anna relaxed her grip on her shoulders, and Elsa collapsed.

She could not understand what was happening. Every thought was muddled, even as the multitude of her denials flooded her mind. Anna would never do this. She felt like she was trapped in a nightmare, submerged under the crushing darkness of the ocean. She wanted, needed, to wake up, but that reprieve never came no matter how hard she wished for it. With the last of her strength, Elsa craned her head to see Anna staring down with pitiless eyes.

"You look so confused," Anna said, sighing.

"Y-You cannot be Anna."

"I am!" Anna said, crouching on one knee at her side. "I'm the only one your defenses don't activate around, right? You have to recognize me. It's not like you could be wrong about something like that." Her eyes curved when she smiled, hiding the distinctly _different_ gaze. "Who you see before you...is Princess Anna of Arendelle."

"I refuse to believe that," Elsa snarled.

She tried to get up, but the knife embedded in her back sent liquid fire coursing through her body. Elsa would have screamed if she could, but the pain was so intense that it stole away her voice, so that her mouth opened into a silent scream of agony. Every movement was torturous. For a while she could see nothing but white, and she thought she might throw up from the pain.

"Be careful, that probably hurt. You should know better than to try to move," Anna said. "And seriously, please don't try to pull the knife out. Your powers are keeping you from being paralyzed for life, but some damage even you can't heal."

"Who…are…you…?"

"I wasn't lying," Anna said, but her cruel gaze softened. She crouched down next to Elsa and brushed back a strand of her hair, smiling when she jerked away. Elsa felt sick. "But you were almost right, I'm more than _just_ Anna. Do you still remember this, Elsa?"

She laid her hand over her face and ripped down, black and purple wisps flowing from her fingertips to form a familiar mask. Shaped like the skull of a beast, bearing a crimson cross burned onto its surface.

It was the mask of the Sorcerer bearing down on her again with its burning gaze.

"But you cannot be Gustaf," Elsa said hoarsely; Anna nodded along with mocking encouragement. "I watched him die, and I watched him be buried."

"Gustaf...is dead, but he was never the man you knew as the Sorcerer," Anna said. Her breathy voice, even filtered and dulled through the mask, betrayed her twisted amusement. "Do you really not recognize anything else…Sis?"

There it was again. She had missed it the first time, too caught up in the moment and horribly dazed by pain, but now that Anna once again called her _Sis_, Elsa realized. Only one person ever called her that, and as unbelievable as the thought was…

"Edmund?" Elsa whispered. "You were the Sorcerer?"

"Oh, I do remember someone by that name."

"But Gustaf even admitted to it! Why would he–?"

"Gustaf was Edmund's father. Not that Edmund knew at first. It surprised him, you know, when Gustaf took the blame willingly! Good fathers are rare, but…they will do anything for their children. Anything to give them a second chance." Anna paused, and her next words were spoken differently from her passionate tone, suddenly murmured, suddenly pensive. "One…they never wanted."

Suddenly, she leaned in so close that the mask came within an inch of her face; Elsa could see the chipped paint and every miniscule crack, and her whitened visage reflected in the dull surface.

"Of course, you would never understand, you, who put so much trust in your beloved dark father, the man who would never do anything for anyone but himself." Anna tilted her head towards Markus, and her voice sounded pained now, furious, bleeding with a cheated rage more intense than anything Elsa thought she felt for Markus. "Do you know what he did to Edmund? After stealing him away from his family, he forced him to make a reliquary. You _know_ what that means. Edmund was only _five_, then."

With a slow, languid motion, Anna drew back.

One wave of her hand, and the mask disappeared. Anna smiled widely, but the expression did not match her face. It was a horrible caricature of the smiles Anna used to have, this crazed smile that stretched too widely, with a predatory baring of her teeth. It didn't hold even an ounce of warmth. Where once there would have been a bright spark, her widened eyes contained only undisguised mania.

"But that name, Edmund. Once, and never again!" Anna sprang to her feet, pacing with such relentless energy that it seemed she could not contain it all. "It's not my name anymore. Now I am – Anna."

"You took her body," Elsa breathed, unable to keep the horror from her voice, speaking the thought aloud because it was so _vile_ that she could not keep it contained.

Edmund had possessed Anna. No wonder she hadn't been able to tell the difference at first, that her powers would not activate to protect herself; Elsa had no defense around Anna. Every one of her senses told her that this person was Anna, but she was only a shell for Edmund. And he had the _gall_ to keep pretending like he was Anna. Elsa wished she could rise and force him out of her, but her rage wasn't enough. As soon as she tried to move, every nerve in her body flared with pain.

Once her vision cleared again, Elsa saw Anna crouching next to Markus. Lying prone and defenseless, the fallen king continued to breathe shallow breaths, unable to even speak, but his eyes were enough. Elsa had never seen this look in his eyes before, resignation and sorrow all at once.

"Hey, Elsa," Anna said, looking back at her and tutting. "I thought you would at least manage to kill Markus. It's not like you to do something halfway. Why would you show pity?"

Anna stood.

"Let me show you how it's done."

Anna lifted her booted foot and brought it hovering over Markus' throat. An instant before it happened, Elsa squeezed her eyes shut. She could still hear the snapping of his neck, the dull crunch of bone and the squelch of blood; but Anna did not yet seem content. Long after Markus died, Anna continued to stomp, laughing wildly, releasing whooping cries of exultation like those of a child.

Elsa only opened her eyes again after there was silence. Markus had been so brutalized that she did not look, but there was blood all along the hem of Anna's dress.

"It's finally done," Anna crowed, spreading her arms wide and spinning about on her heel, her bloodstained dress flourishing in spectacle of her kill. "After all these years, finally, finally done!"

Whether out of nervous energy or some cruel need to assert her victory, Anna whirled around towards Elsa and continued speaking, blurting out her words at a fevered pitch.

"Edmund was the Sorcerer all along," Anna said. "Nobody had any idea, but Edmund was watching me as soon as I arrived, as soon as _you_ brought me here. All those times Edmund told me to look past your flaws, to get to know you, to get past your walls – all planned. And now…"

Anna grinned.

"Only I can awaken your heart again."

Anna strode towards the reliquary suspended up above. She held out her hand and beckoned for it to come, and Elsa watched in horror as her heart responded. It glowed with an ethereal light and, slowly, very slowly, began its descent, until its form became visible. Inside the perfect sphere of transparent blue ice, the snowflake that was her heart drifted in perpetual purgatory.

It would be freed soon enough.

"As soon as we met, you were curious, and fascinated," Anna said. "Because unlike everybody else, I wasn't afraid of you."

At the top of the orb, the smallest crack appeared.

"When I was hurt and sick, you started to feel care. When you found out that you could touch me without hurting me, you started to feel hope. When Alvard almost killed me, you felt fear and desperation; and then relief when I was safe. After that…you forgot your inhibitions. You decided to give me everything. You decided you would try to feel again."

With every word the crack widened, spidering across the surface of the orb.

"When I told you that I wasn't afraid, you felt hope as you never had before. When Tobias threatened that hope, only for me to understand you even more, you began to feel so much more. Everything flooded back, both the good and the bad. Disappointment at the thought that you couldn't be the way you were before. Despair at the thought that you would never be enough for me."

Light shone from the inside of the orb, spilling out through the cracks like a contained sun would burst forth. With each passing moment the reliquary released a louder, shriller screech.

"But you loved me. Every moment we spent together awakened the elation in your heart, the wonder and the delight, the joy of intimacy and the comfort of warmth. Even when we were at odds, those were things you would never have felt before. Hurt that I could not accept your choices, and then the pain of betrayal when we separated. Until, finally, you could admit that you loved me."

Anna reached out for the reliquary, and Elsa could do nothing but watch and wait for the inevitable.

"Everything that happened was for the purpose of weakening the defenses you had built. Because of me, you felt every emotion again," Anna murmured, each word washing over her senses like a silken caress. "You gave me your love, and I became the only person who your heart would accept."

One by one, the barriers that protected her reliquary fell away.

Elsa had no defenses against Anna.

All the ice that surrounded her heart thawed in response to Anna, until the orb unveiled the snowflake hidden away inside, and her heart lay unprotected. Anna tilted her head as she studied the snowflake, all of her manic energy suddenly vanished into calm satisfaction. Just before she could reach out for it, Elsa crawled her way forward, biting past the pain, and Anna looked down with amusement.

"You could _not_ have planned all of our experiences," Elsa said.

"Love is the greatest weapon in the world," Anna said, whipping her hand towards Markus. "See how that disgusting man manipulated you! Love kept the one person who could kill him from killing him. Love is a more powerful and devastating hold than any other manipulation."

"What Anna and I had was real–!"

"Which only makes it all the more powerful…but all things must have a beginning." Anna smiled. "It was Edmund who convinced me to give you a chance. In other words, the _Sorcerer_ was the one to tie us together. Do you remember his powers? Well, I never had much of a choice."

Elsa froze, feeling nearly sick at the thought, but before she could voice anything more–

"Thank you for loving me."

Anna drew the reliquary forward, and Elsa felt every bond between herself and her heart begin to snap. She felt the frayed ties that held them together begin to come apart at last, as her heart abandoned her, just as she had abandoned it so many years ago. Elsa felt her heart finally choose a new master, and for the first time in her life...

She began to feel cold.

* * *

Here was her moment of triumph.

As the reliquary approached, Anna spread her arms wide open in invitation.

Its light pierced through her chest and reached her heart, seizing her very being with its ephemeral touch. Anna gasped aloud at the utter _warmth_ that flooded every sinew of her body, as though she were absorbing the sun, and the sheer ecstasy threatened to overwhelm her mind. Her entire body bent backwards as the reliquary phased past the mundane mortal shell of her body and settled into divinity, into her heart, sending its energy pulsing through her veins.

Absolution.

Anna closed her eyes and took a deep breath, relishing the cold winter air in her lungs and that, for the first time in so many years, she _needed_ to breathe at all. She could feel the blood rushing in her veins. She could feel the tempest of emotions repressed all this time, the sadness, the joy, so strongly that she thought she might break down into tears at any second, and yet she would laugh, and laugh, and laugh.

She could feel the power embedded in her heart.

She could reach it now, this all-consuming power that was an infinite wealth of divine might.

"How could you ever willingly give this up?" Anna asked, laughing, but Elsa was too broken to speak. Curled into fetal position, shaking with terrible tremors as the last ties of her magic unraveled and left her the corpse that she was, her agony was an all-too familiar experience. Anna knew that feeling well.

When she had still been Edmund, and he felt his fleeting time on this earth slipping away–

Well, that was in another lifetime which no longer mattered.

Anna extended her hand towards the Mirror still awaiting its awakening. At the instant her newfound powers resonated with its own, the progenitor of shadow and ice, the Mirror shone with brilliant luminosity. All the skies darkened. All the earth trembled. From every corner of the world, the remaining shards heard her call and tore from their human shells to return to the Southern Isles. Swirling about in the storm that raged overhead, dust melded into splinters, splinters jointed into shards, and the shards merged into the Mirror to form an almost unbroken expanse. Only the core remained.

Anna forced her will upon the Mirror.

They shared a single heart.

She would _become_ the Mirror now.

Within its hollowed center appeared the snowflake crest of her heart, spinning ceaselessly, and the lines on the glass surface blazed with swoops and whirls of light. It spilled forth and pierced the heavens, terrible and beautiful all at once, and what was once broken came into its majesty again. Completed, the Mirror thrummed with the power of creation.

Edmund – _Anna_ – had won.

* * *

When they received their orders to return at once, none of the princes knew what to expect.

But Saul could perceive that something was different as soon as they stepped foot in the Southern Isles. It was something that could not be seen, only felt, an omnipresent sense of wrongness that pervaded the kingdom. Magic suffused the air so that it felt thicker now, cloying, and a discordant, keening note in the fell wind sang of subtle torment. It seemed oddly sentient, malevolent, passing over the skin and cutting deep with a vibration of amusement.

"Something's wrong," Hans said.

"Will you stop fussing?" Fabian said, snorting.

But Alek must have felt the oppressive atmosphere too; Saul saw the unease in his eyes, and he soon bent down to whisper something to Hans. Saul glanced to his left, and Oliver, too, was shuddering. Out of the eight, only the four of them could feel it, then. Perhaps they had some commonality…

Saul could only think of one.

Once they arrived at the castle, several of the others gasped aloud at the rampant destruction. Entire towers had collapsed, their crumbled remains strewn across the courtyard. Aberrations grew from the walls, strange metals contorted into impossible shapes; tendrils of iron curved meters into the air and oscillated with the wind. Most telling, though, was the uppermost tower that had been torn asunder, now circled by a dark shadow crackling with lightning.

"We should head inside," Saul said, snapping the rest out of their trances.

They picked their way through the debris and filed into the castle, stepping through the front doors that had been ripped apart. It was even worse inside. Paintings had been destroyed, their depicted faces melted into waxy contortions, and the floors, ripped asunder, looked as though they had suffered through an earthquake.

Soundlessly, they continued on.

Straight down the hall, Saul could see into the throne room.

Sitting on the throne was an obviously female figure, but in the darkness that loomed over the castle, her face was obscured by shadow. For just an instant, Saul believed Elsa awaited them. As strange as it was that Markus did not claim the throne, Elsa would have been a logical sight. But with every step, that hope was disproved. Saul saw the glint of a different crown, not of ice but a tiara inlaid with a blood-red stone, and that crown was set upon red hair twisted into a neat bun. Amidst the darkness gleamed eyes a different shade of blue, not dark but turquoise.

As soon as they stepped into the throne room, Saul saw…

It was Anna.

"Welcome back," Anna said, and though she spoke softly, her voice carried with unnatural strength. It ghosted over the senses, so that a shuddering feeling shivered down the spine.

For a moment, they were all too stunned to speak. Anna rose from the throne, and everything about her was different. Not just her appearance, though the dark cloak that swept over the floor did not match her usual brightness. She moved with an elegant regality that Anna had never possessed, and she was too poised, too calm, as she studied them all where they stood.

When Saul met her eyes, Anna quirked her lips into a small smile.

Saul felt terror as he had never known.

"What the hell are you doing here?" Fabian said.

"Markus is dead, and Elsa deposed," Anna announced. "You will address me as Queen Anna."

Anna turned her gaze to him, and even stubborn, obstinate Fabian gave pause at the absolute authority that she exuded. Here was the source of the heavy pressure lying over the Southern Isles, Saul realized.

"Anna!" Alek stepped forward, holding out his hands. "What's going on? Why are you–?"

"We knew each other well, once," Anna said, her pitch strained, as though she were forcibly restraining herself. "If you will submit to me, then you can have anything that you desire. But I extend this offer to you all. Loyalty, for your eternal happiness."

"Who do you think you are to order us around?" Fabian spat, drawing the sword that he still wielded from their battles. "Get out of my sight, you stupid girl."

If Saul had cared for him at all, he might have tried to stop his foolish advance. When Fabian moved forward, though, only Cyrus bothered to say anything, and only a halfhearted attempt at that.

Anna threw out her hand, and the shrill screech of electricity was all that they could hear, the blinding flash of lightning was all that they could see. Lightning tore from her hand and struck Fabian in the chest.

Saul forced his eyes open once the light had passed.

Even Fabian appeared uncomprehending of what had just happened. For another moment he wavered between life and death, eyes wide with disbelief, and he looked down, slowly, to where his armor had been rent open with terrifying violence. Saul looked as well, but averted his gaze from the wound beneath. It was a horrible sight. Fabian collapsed, bloodless, the cavity of his chest cauterized by flame.

"Does anyone else have any objections?" Anna asked.

Immediately, the rest fell to their knees. Saul, too stunned by the display, forgot himself; Oliver pulled him down, breathing so harshly with fear that his ragged gasps must have been painful. None of them had been this fearful even of Elsa. But, Saul thought, those _were_ her powers. Only even stronger now, and _that_ had been something he never thought possible. Even the lingering magic from the last outburst was overwhelming, the crushing pressure enough to choke out his breath.

"Will you alone defy me…Alek?"

Alek had remained standing.

"I would rather die too, than go along with this charade," Alek declared. "Who are you? Whoever you are, you are terrible at impersonating Anna."

Anna looked hurt. "We have been through so much, you, and me, and Hans. You two have always been at my side. I may not be the same Anna you knew, but we can still work together–"

"Work together and do what, exactly?"

Alek pointed to Fabian, and Anna said nothing.

"I'm going to pass." Alek drew his sword, and Saul could only think, how foolish, but also how admirable, that the younger prince could be so adamant in the face of this nightmare. "Now, I'm going to ask again. Who are you, and what have you done to Anna?"

"…I told you already, I'm Anna."

"Do you think I'm stupid?" Alek said, sneering. "Anna would never kill, and she would never try to force her authority on anyone. What, do you really think that _you_ are anything like Anna?"

Anna's features twisted with an ugly rage, barely recognizable from the flawless image she had acted out. Saul managed to glance towards Alek just before the inevitable, and he wondered if Alek had known this was coming, because there was no surprise on his face, only calm acceptance. Alek ran forward and Anna slashed her hand down, and an arc of ice struck Alek faster than the eye could follow.

What Saul _could_ see was the ice spreading across his body, blossoming from his chest to freeze him entirely. Alek was just beginning to ascend the dais when it happened, and his sword, still raised and poised to strike, stilled within his frozen grasp. Alek's last breath escaped as a thin cloud of steam, and then he was still, only a frozen statue.

"What about you, Hans?" Anna asked.

Hans stared soundlessly at the statue, and the smoldering fury in his eyes made Saul think that he would go the same way. But slowly, his death grip on his wheelchair relaxed. Hans exhaled a long breath, and he bowed his head towards Anna.

"I submit to the will of Queen Anna," Hans said.

Anna smiled. "Very good. Should I assume that the rest of you are in agreement?"

There was a chorus of pledges, and then silence again.

"You are all dismissed," Anna said, and then her smile widened. "But Saul, stay for another moment."

As though this were any other court assemblage led by Markus, the other princes left the throne room. Except their steps were hurried, disorderly, lacking the careful precision that they would usually exhibit, and it was a testament to how eager they were to escape. Saul stayed where he was, though he longed to go with them. Anywhere but here. Anywhere but with this _thing_ that had taken over Anna.

Saul nearly jumped when Anna clicked her tongue.

"Why are you so quiet? Aren't we good friends by now?" Anna laughed when Saul raised his head, and the sudden shift in her tone threw him for a loss until Saul realized that _this_ was the way she truly was, and the regality was only an act to mask the madness. "Come on, I know you're smarter than that. You've got to have _some_ idea."

Only long years of practice told Saul that, despite her words, he did not yet have permission to speak.

Anna seemed vaguely disappointed that he didn't take the bait.

"You have been _so_ loyal to me," Anna said, somehow managing to sound deeply grateful and mocking all at once. "Although you didn't always know it. But you realized it pretty recently, right? Because you stayed quiet, my secret was hidden just long enough for all _this_ to be possible."

Anna fixed him with a long stare, her head tilted.

"So I was right," Saul breathed.

At one time he had believed Gustaf was the Sorcerer. But when Edmund had fallen ill and Saul became the one to look after him, he discovered the ravaged state of his body, the decay of his health. It was exactly like the symptoms shown by Elsa. It was exactly like the symptoms of one who had created a reliquary. And when he had tried to tell Elsa, he found that he could not. Magic bound him to silence.

And that was when Saul knew that _Edmund_ had been the one behind the mask.

"Not quite," Anna said, gesturing for him to come close, and Saul did so, barely able to contain his revulsion. She sounded...different, again. Like she couldn't make up her mind. "You should learn exactly whom you are serving. Misguided loyalty will not be tolerated."

"Whom I'm serving…?" Saul said, discomfited. "I thought…I thought…"

"You thought right!" Anna said, pitch rising back into something that almost seemed like herself. "But Edmund's not around anymore. Edmund and Anna have merged into one being, so you don't serve Edmund anymore. It's Anna that exists now. Only _I_ exist now."

Saul nodded. Now that he stood at the base of the platform, he was only a step away from Alek. It was a haunting sight, to see his brash brother entrapped by ice. Not that there was any love between them, but Alek had been one of the more agreeable members of their family.

"Oh, he's still alive," Anna said, grinning. "Alek will be useful to me, eventually. It'll take some work, but I'll convince him."

"What will you do to him?"

"I didn't think you'd care. Guess I really don't know you that well." Anna laughed and shook her head. "I mean, I thought you would ask about someone else. Well, I guess she was right about your so-called love after all."

"Is Elsa…?"

"Still alive, and sort of well," Anna said. "Don't worry, I'll hold up my end of our bargain. I promised you that at the end of this, you would have her for your own."

Anna motioned for him to follow.

Saul feared for what he would soon see.
