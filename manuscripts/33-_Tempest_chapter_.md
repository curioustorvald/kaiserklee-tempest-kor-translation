**Chapter 33: Onward to the Northern Kingdom**

Anna left bright and early in the morning, better rested and more cheered than she had been since an eternity ago. Things were finally looking up. The Sorcerer had been defeated, and her relationship with Elsa mended. She was even going home to Arendelle, something she hadn't dared to let herself _dream_ about since arriving at the Southern Isles. But back then Anna would never have believed that, one day, she would be exhilarated at the thought of Elsa coming with her too. Anna couldn't stop smiling at the thought of seeing the home she had longed for with the person she loved most.

Before she left, though…

"Why do you have flowers everywhere?" Anna asked.

Alek scowled and looked away. "It's a hobby. Everyone has a hobby, all right? It's not that weird. I just happen to be good with plants, and–"

"Call them plants all you like, but these are flowers," Hans said.

"Don't make me tip you over." Alek rattled his wheelchair, but when Hans looked down with a smile he whirled around to Kristoff instead. "Back me up. It's not that weird, right?"

"Look, I talk for a reindeer and sing duets with myself, and I still think this is pretty weird," Kristoff said, shrugging when Alek fumed.

Anna stifled a laugh when the three resumed their banter. Contrary to her expectations, she had made good friends in the Southern Isles. She had come here expecting to be a prisoner locked away in some dank dungeon, and instead she had fallen in love with Elsa and met this eccentric group. It felt fitting to have a group meeting before leaving, especially when everything had been so morbid lately.

Which was why they were camped out in Alek's room.

And scratching their heads about the odd decor.

Anna had done a double-take when she saw that the gruff prince had filled his room with flowers. She had expected swords, and there was indeed a whetstone and several blades hanging on the walls; but along with his weapons was the boggling sight of tall lilacs growing in all four corners. She had no idea how they even survived with the minimal sunlight, but Alek went as far as to keep a miniature flower garden beneath the floor of his room, visible through a glass pane. All the varieties were quite honestly impressive: white and red roses, lilies and honey suckles, and daisies and carnations.

"I think they're pretty," Anna offered. Alek narrowed his eyes in suspicion, and rightfully so, because Anna cracked a wide grin. "Pretty weird."

"Oliver laid railroad tracks in his room and rides a cart to his bed, and no one finds that out of the ordinary," Alek raged. "Have you seen it? How can anyone be _that_ lazy?"

"Maybe I should requisition that in my room too, being somewhat inconvenienced and all," Hans deadpanned.

Alek looked ready to explode, so Anna stepped in to break up the fight just waiting to happen. "All right, we were just kidding. It's really not that weird, but the way you react…"

"Just be totally open about it," Kristoff suggested. "We all have that one weird thing. See, I'm the Reindeer Guy, Prince Hans is the Wheelchair Guy, no offense–"

"None taken."

"–and you can be the–"

"Swords Guy."

"–Flower Guy," Kristoff finished, leaning against the wall with a self-satisfied air. Anna supposed it was lucky she was around, since if the way he kept looking towards his swords was any indication, Alek was debating the merits of actually murdering Kristoff. But then again, this unlikely group wouldn't all be in the same vicinity if not for her. Funny how things worked.

"So you wanted to see us," Hans said, thankfully diverting the conversation to safer subjects. Anna always knew he was reliable.

"I just thought it would be nice to have a normal-ish conversation before I left for Arendelle," Anna said. She winced. "Not that this is the slightest bit normal, but at least not, you know, dark."

Alek frowned. "You're leaving?"

"Well, I'm coming back! Just visiting home for a bit." Anna grinned, but faltered when she realized she had yet to share the bad news. "Oh, and I should probably apologize in advance because I'm taking Elsa with me and she sort of, maybe…decided to leave Saul in charge again."

"And we all know that turned out splendidly last time," Hans said.

"Well, he seems all right now," Alek muttered, and Anna had to agree that he was nothing but helpful lately. For a while, she had suspected him of deliberately impeding their search for the Sorcerer, but now that everything was over and there was no evidence, she was willing to put it aside. At any rate, she didn't have much of a choice in the matter.

"I'm surprised Queen Elsa was fine with this," Kristoff said.

"…It took some convincing."

Kristoff turned red, opening and closing his mouth without uttering a sound. Hans raised his eyebrows, but Anna only realized how her words might be interpreted when Alek once again inflated. "So there _is_ some wicked exchange going on here–!"

"No! Just give that a rest," Anna huffed. "Can't we talk about something normal people talk about for once? How about the weather lately?"

"I predict a chance of snow," Hans said.

"It's funny how I didn't like you before and I don't like you now, but for entirely different reasons," Alek said, and Hans made a sound suspiciously like a snort. "So, Anna. Any idea when you'll be coming back?"

"I'm not sure, but I don't think Elsa will want to be away too long."

"Well, I'm glad you'll be back soon." Kristoff uncrossed his arms as he pushed off the wall. "Something has to be up with Edmund, I couldn't find him anywhere. I'm guessing you didn't have any luck either."

"…Oh. Yeah, Edmund couldn't make it." If Anna regretted one thing before leaving, that was being unable to find Edmund. Not for lack of trying. Nobody knew where Edmund had gone to, and Anna had even braved asking Fabian, to no avail. If Edmund didn't want to be found, Anna was sure that he knew the nooks and crannies of the castle better than she ever would. After leaving a note at his room, she decided to give him space for now.

"I'm sure this has been hard on him," Alek said.

Anna smiled wryly. "You have no idea."

"Although, I have to admit…" Hans looked down at his feet, gaze darkening. "Well, I would be lying if I said I wasn't just a little resentful for his silence. It would have spared us a lot of grief."

"Yeah," Anna muttered. Hans was taking his debilitation well now, but she was sure that he missed his old strength. Anyone would. "How are you adjusting?"

"It's not terrible." Hans wheeled forward as if to demonstrate his point, and then back again, nearly crushing Alek's foot in the process. Ignoring the rampant swears launched his way, he continued, "And what matters is that my mind and will are intact. Ironic, but I guess I should thank Elsa for her words. And Kristoff, I owe you thanks as well for taking care of Sitron in my stead."

"Part of the job, and Sitron is great," Kristoff said, scratching the back of his neck and shrugging. "But I think he misses you. Animals can tell you a lot about people, and the way Sitron loves you…well, you must have been good to him."

"Sitron was gifted to me by my mother." Hans smiled, and there was something peaceful in his expression that had always been lacking until now. Less rigid, Anna thought, more relaxed, and the difference looked good on him. "Yes, I'll visit soon. Hopefully Alek will be willing to accompany me, but I could always just ask Oliver to build tracks."

"Whatever."

Anna smiled. She had missed this easy camaraderie. It was fulfilling to see the unlikely trio together, and even better to be part of this tight-knit group where all of them stood on equal footing. Perhaps not in status – Kristoff was forced labor, Anna herself technically a prisoner of war, and Hans physically crippled – but emotionally, mentally, they were all equals. For all their problems, they were secure in themselves. Maybe, Anna realized, that was why it was so easy with them. Maybe…

"Hey, Anna," Kristoff said.

"Oh! Sorry, I was just thinking weird thoughts." Anna blinked. She had completely lost her train of thought. No matter how hard she concentrated, the half-formed realization escaped her.

"Your face is all scrunched up. Reminds me of a sneezing horse," Alek said. While Anna grappled for a retort, he raised an eyebrow. "Shouldn't you be going soon?"

"Oh, shoot. Elsa is probably waiting for me." Anna grinned, rocking on her feet back and forth, struck by giddy anticipation. "And home is waiting for me too! I'll see you all when I get back!"

"Don't forget souvenirs," Kristoff said.

"Sandwiches," Hans added.

Anna strode out of the room with a jaunty smile and a laugh, already dreaming of home.

* * *

When Anna entered the Great Hall, Elsa was already waiting. She stood rigid and with her fingers interlaced, but once she caught sight of Anna, Elsa relaxed. Anna sprinted forward with gusto when Elsa extended her hand, nearly crashing into the queen before just managing to stop a finger's breadth away. Elsa looked vaguely relieved that Anna wasn't hurdling towards her at maximum velocity anymore, but after coming to a stop, Anna decided to just go for the surprise hug. She grabbed Elsa without warning, squeezing her midsection with all her strength.

"I'm so glad we're doing this!" Anna squealed.

Elsa freed one arm and patted Anna on the back. Anna looked up with a grin, but Elsa seemed to be struggling for words. Finally, after a few seconds of looking down with frantically widened eyes, Elsa opened her mouth and choked out a strangled wheeze.

"Whoops, too enthusiastic," Anna laughed, letting go of her captive queen.

"I was _going_ to say that I was glad too," Elsa said, voice flat, but her lips pulled up into a small smile when Anna kept up an unfaltering grin. "Well, I still am. Are you ready to head out?"

"Way too ready!"

Elsa led them out to the courtyard, and Anna remembered being dropped off here by Kristoff long ago. It would have been nice to get a ride to the docks, actually. Anna looked to Elsa. "Uhh, I sort of forgot. How are we getting there, exactly?"

"We'll be taking my ship." Elsa gave her an odd look. "Arendelle _is_ across the seas."

"Well, yeah, but how are we getting to the docks?" Anna blinked. She couldn't imagine Elsa actually walking much. It just seemed mundane. And Anna was far from lazy, but she couldn't imagine even herself walking that much. Not that the cold bothered either of them, but it was _really_ far.

"You might want to hold on tight."

"Okayyy," Anna said, holding on to Elsa's waist as directed but bemused by the directive. "I still don't see how we're getting there–!"

Elsa shifted her foot. Anna swallowed her sentence and switched to a scream when she found herself propelled along the snow, and she had no idea _how_ until she looked down. Where once lay a calm plain now rose a surging mass of snow beneath their feet, rippling like an ocean wave to carry them forward. Snow rose and fell in a continuous oscillation, pushing their elevated pedestal along, and it moved _fast_ too. At twice the speed of a galloping horse, the wind whipped past and threw Anna's pigtails back. Elsa was laughing now, but Anna clutched at her waist and pressed up flush against her body for protection. All she could do was hang on for dear life when the snow surged upwards at a sixty-five degree angle, forming a five meter tall ramp to scale the courtyard's fountain.

"You're a crazy driver!" Anna screamed. She spat out a mouthful of hair and dared to look behind for a second. Oh, God, they were so high up. Anna buried her head into Elsa's back again.

"It's safe, I promise. Just enjoy the ride," Elsa said.

Elsa had a strange definition of safe.

Anna had the sudden sensation of weightlessness, and she _knew_ something was wrong when she felt the entire world spin. Against her better judgment she opened her eyes...and shrieked, crying bloody murder while Elsa laughed. Now they were sailing through the sky, freefalling without restraint, having been launched off the snow entirely once the ramp peaked over the fountain. Elsa laughed again and caught them on another rising wave of snow, landing on her feet and sliding without missing a beat while they spiked downwards back toward the ground. Anna took deep breaths trying to calm her beating heart when they sped forward and burst through the front gates.

"Really, Anna. I thought you'd like this," Elsa said, turning backwards and letting the snow move of its own accord though town. It nearly crashed into one of the houses before taking a sharp turn into the narrower corridors, snaking through the paths with expert precision. "Here, you might feel better if you balanced yourself."

Anna held on tighter. "Don't you dare!"

"Trust me." Elsa pried her hands away and pulled Anna up into a precarious half-crouching, half-standing position, and all the while, the wave of snow under them continued to undulate.

"Okay, I can do this," Anna muttered. Not that she had much choice. She wobbled once or twice, but Elsa steadied her until she could stand. "Wait! Don't let go yet!"

"It's easier if you use your arms to balance," Elsa said. She was enjoying this way too much. Anna could see the gleam of mischief in her eyes. "Just do what I do. I'll catch you if you fall."

Elsa let go and the snow separated into two separate waves, each of them standing on their own ride. Anna hurriedly followed Elsa's example and spread her legs out a little more, bending her knees, outstretching her arms. Huh. It really wasn't too bad when she could control herself a little bit more. It was pretty fun, actually, feeling the wind blow past her ears with a dull roar. More than fun. Anna let out a loud whoop when the snow surged up and down again. It was _freedom_, flying without restraint.

"I see why you like this so much," Anna said, grinning at Elsa beside her.

"And you picked it up quickly." Elsa crouched low and directed her snow into a quick corkscrew off a spiral of ice, smiling just as wide as Anna.

"Did you come up with this?"

"No, I copied this from some of the natives at the old colonies. Except they do this on boards in the water. Surfing," Elsa explained. "I can go faster, but you might not–"

"I like fast!" Anna yelled.

It was exhilarating.

Not that they could really race, since Elsa was in control of both waves, but she made the illusion of it all the same. And what an illusion it was. Anna let out a victorious shout when she pulled ahead, sliding off a ramp over an obtrusive rock and landing on rolling snow once again. All of this was amazing: the exultation of speed, the rush of competition, and best of all, the sight of Elsa beside her, enjoying the moment every bit as much.

Soon, the docks were in sight. Elsa threw out her hands and two twisted curves of ice rose from the ground, curled inward like a frozen wave. They hit the slides at the same time and sheer speed thrust them forward. Nearly horizontal on the ice, Anna met Elsa's eyes across the plains between them. Not too long now, they would converge.

Elsa smiled.

Anna flew off the ramp, sure that she would reach the docks. She was so close! She looked to her side and then back, trying to find Elsa, but she was nowhere in sight. Where was she? Oh, there she was, riding the snow way down below for some reason. And now Elsa was grinning, reaching out towards her – Anna widened her eyes when she found herself pulled down, the snow beneath her feet suddenly subject to gravity once more.

"No fair!" Anna yelled.

"Anything goes," Elsa said.

Elsa zoomed under Anna and caught her bridal-style. Together, they rushed forward past the last few paces, going so fast that they ended up tumbling off and into the snow. Soft landing; Anna felt like she was on a giant pillow when they rolled across to the dock. Anna giggled and stretched out on her back with eyes closed. Well, that was an experience. And it was so comfortable on this giant bed of snow…

"Don't fall asleep now."

Anna opened her eyes and her breath hitched. She stared up at Elsa leaning down with hands planted on either side of her, lips forming a gentle smile, eyes clouded over with adrenaline and…something a little more intense. Anna's gaze went straight to her lips, heart leaping into her throat when Elsa poked out her tongue and swiped across, her own lips parting without thought. And they simply lay there together, synchronized breaths deepening, staring at each other.

Elsa bent down at the exact moment Anna reached up to pull her into a kiss, their lips meeting more roughly than they had ever kissed before. Anna loved how Elsa moved. Her body was bent like the curve of a bow pulled taut, the potential for violence coiled in the sinew of muscle, and somehow that only made it more exciting. Maybe it was the adrenaline still running through her veins. Anna dug her fingers into Elsa's hips and dragged her as close as possible, moaning into their kiss.

And Elsa made it even better, so pleasurable that it was painful. She was kissing back just as furiously, using her whole body and not just her mouth. Even as Anna felt her bite on her lower lip and thrust her tongue into her mouth, Elsa's hands made their way over her body, tracing the curve of her waist and snaking upward. Elsa raked her other hand through Anna's hair, tilting her head upwards so her neck was exposed. Anna writhed when she felt lips over her throat, teeth scraping against delicate skin to the side, tongue soothing her before it all started over again.

"E-Elsa," Anna gasped. She was moving up now, lips brushing against her jaw, breath fanning over the shell of her ear and sending a shudder spasming through her entire body. She locked Elsa's thigh in between her own and rocked up against her, only separated by sheer fabric and ice. "God, Elsa!"

"Anna…" Elsa groaned. "W-We should…stop."

Anna paid no attention and kissed her again, but after one last time Elsa slid away, resisting Anna's feeble attempt to pull her back down and rising to her feet. Anna lay there, panting her frustration, but Elsa was hardly any better. She was breathing just as heavily, as though she had forgotten she didn't even need air. After a long moment, Elsa offered her a hand.

"We are…going to need to continue later," Elsa breathed. Her eyes hadn't quite cleared yet. She looked away. "We're out in wide open space, and even if no one is around, I – I wouldn't feel right."

"N-No, you're probably right." Anna cleared her throat and straightened out her dress, feeling her cheeks redden with a flush of embarrassment. "So, uhh, the ship, to Arendelle?"

"…Right here."

Not that Anna could have missed the elegant ship of ice amidst the crude fleet of warships. It was the same one Elsa had taken to Arendelle. She remembered it well, the ethereal ship that glittered like a diamond with a thousand facets, reflecting the light and refracting it into a rainbow of color. She had always found it more beautiful than imposing, a work of art rather than an instrument of war. Painstaking attention must have gone into its crafting. Each ridge and crest was perfectly symmetrical, forming the sleek, streamlined hull of a frigate. Even the masts were fitted with sails of ice curved inwards to give the illusion of wind.

"I always wanted to ride this," Anna admitted. She scratched the back of her neck when Elsa sent a questioning glance her way. "Way back when I first saw it, I thought I'd be riding this here."

"Now you'll be riding it home," Elsa said.

With a wave of her hand, Elsa summoned a staircase that substituted for the usual ramp. Anna jumped up onto the ship, awed just by being able to step foot on the beautiful creation. Though made of ice, the vessel was not transparent but opaque, having a blue tint enough to block the sight of the sea on the other side. Anna was still busy admiring the frigate when Elsa stepped aboard, but even she noticed the sudden hum that sounded the instant Elsa touched her ship.

"Wait. Is that actually coming from the ship?" Anna asked.

Elsa nodded, placing her hand over the mast and closing her eyes. "It responds to me. I told you before that I can hear the ice and snow. All of it has life, and it yearns for…perfection."

"Do you think you could try and explain to me?"

"Think of the ice as having a heart at its core. It's _meant_ to be more than its mundane form, something locked away and hidden inside," Elsa said. "Everything entrapping that core is excess, imperfection. It wants the excess to be cast off, to be purified and refined into something greater."

"And that's what you do," Anna said.

Elsa smiled. "At the least, I try."

"Well, I think it's beautiful." Anna traced the unveined, unmarred surface of the ship. "When did you make this?"

"One of my first works. Back when it was easier, and maybe that's why it still responds so well to me," Elsa said. Without even moving, she made the sails retract and rematerialize. "Have you noticed the design, compared to the rest of the ships here?"

Anna looked overboard to the fleet, all of them metal-hulled, equipped with guns and having large exhaust pipes jutting out from deck, heavy and meant for crushing through anything in its path. Elsa's ship was not like those at all. It was slimmer, elegant, and still possessed sails, and Anna realized its design was much more in the vein of an antiquated style. It was a style still used in...Arendelle.

"It influenced me then. Maybe it still does now," Elsa admitted.

"It'll be good to see Arendelle again, I promise," Anna said.

"Arendelle isn't my home anymore." Elsa didn't sound angry, or resentful. She only stated it as fact, and Anna wished more than anything this could be a homecoming for both of them. Maybe her expression showed. Elsa smiled and took Anna's hand. "But this should be a happy occasion for you, right?"

"Yeah." Anna squeezed her hand and grinned. "All right! When can we set out? But don't surprise me again with some crazy surfing thing."

"Perfectly normal sailing," Elsa said.

About as normal as everything else Elsa could do, which was still not at all normal. One moment they were motionless in the harbor, and the next, the ship had begun its voyage without even the slightest delay. Some other vessel might have had a slow start, creaking over the jagged shards of ice floating in the water to an unsteady rhythm, but not Elsa's frigate. It passed over the treacherous waters without needing the clumsy brute force of the icebreakers, all the ice parting to either side as though an invisible barrier surrounded the frigate. And it was, of course, sailing without anything powering its movement.

"Not even a little normal. How exactly does this thing move?" But darn it, Elsa looked so smug. Anna smacked her palm. "No. Don't tell me. I can figure this out."

"Not even a hint?"

Anna scoffed and strode forward to stand at the bow, ignoring the little laugh from Elsa. It couldn't be that hard. Process of elimination. She already knew that Elsa could summon gusts of wind, but that couldn't be the answer. For one thing, the ice sails were there for decoration and couldn't really catch the wind, but even if they were able, Anna didn't feel any wind pushing them forward, only the wind resistance from their advance. Second theory. Elsa was able to direct ice and snow to move through the _air_, and surely it wouldn't be that different going through water…

"Are you using psychic powers again?" Anna asked.

"It was never psychic, but no, not that." Elsa blinked, looking mildly impressed. "Although that would be the more obvious solution. I don't know why I never thought of that."

"You _would_ do something fancy."

Anna sat with her legs dangling over the bow, watching the crests of water rising as the ship pressed forward. Electricity didn't seem like it would help with anything. Would probably just electrocute them all. Well, she was fresh out of ideas. While Anna kept pondering, Elsa sat down beside her and wrapped an arm around her waist.

"Are you sure you don't want a hint?"

"Stop distracting me." Anna leaned over and pecked Elsa on the cheek, trying to think of something as complicated as possible. "All right, I think I have it now. So the ship isn't actually moving."

"…What?" Elsa looked at her with furrowed eyebrows. "We are very clearly moving."

"See, you're trying to trick me. It's just the illusion of movement," Anna said, voice growing in volume as her excitement built. "I bet the ship just keeps rebuilding itself! Like the ice extends forward, and then loses part of the back, then the ice goes forward again, really, really fast, so the ship just keeps–"

"Replicating itself infinitely to imitate movement through space," Elsa finished, and Anna grinned before she added, "And I thought my methods were convoluted."

"No way," Anna said. "It's gotta be that. It would be so cool!"

"It's also incredibly inefficient," Elsa said, and Anna felt pretty scandalized by the obvious amusement Elsa was getting out of this. "Should I just tell you?"

"…Fine."

Elsa stretched out her hand toward the sea with her pointer finger extended, and Anna saw the faint blue glow at the tip crackling with…electricity. Anna scowled. "I made the ship out of magnetized ice," Elsa explained. "So I expel another magnetic field of opposite charge in front of us, and we'll automatically move forward. It has the benefit of pushing away obstacles without taking concentration on my part, leaving me free to do…this."

Anna's complaint was muffled when Elsa kissed her, and by the time the queen pulled away, Anna had forgotten all about the ship. She was having a hard time focusing on anything, actually, and Elsa smiled before stretching out flat on her back to stare up at the skies. It was a strange sight, actually, and Anna had to think for a moment before she realized why. It was the sun. Not the harsh, unfiltered, _cold_ light back at the Southern Isles, but golden rays of sunshine, and seeing Elsa bathed in that light was surreal.

Scrambling to her feet, Anna looked up and gasped at the sight of blue skies and white clouds. She looked back and realized the Southern Isles wasn't even visible anymore, instead replaced by miles and miles of ocean. Anna let out whoops of delight, looked down, saw Elsa staring at her with amusement, and laughed even louder. She stretched out her arms and took in a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the sun on her skin and smelling the salt of the ocean.

Freedom.

For both of them.

"Thank you," Anna breathed.

Elsa smiled. "Anything for you. Come and join me?"

Anna lay down and snuggled into Elsa's embrace, for once warm and content at the side of her ice queen, and she knew that this was what she had always wanted.

"Your condition is deteriorating."

Saul poured out a bowl of steamed medicinal tea and handed it to Edmund. It perplexed him how, even after all of his best treatments, the younger prince had worsened with time. Edmund had always been extraordinarily healthy, never once in living memory catching even the most minor of colds; Saul couldn't fathom what was wrong now. Not that it was obvious. On the surface everything _had_ healed, Edmund was looking better than ever, but small things tipped him off. Cracking skin. Hair loss. Easy bruising. Saul doubted anyone else could have noticed just how Edmund was faring.

Edmund received the medicine with a small shake of his head.

"No, I'm fine," Edmund said, but he drank it down anyway without complaint. It was strange. Saul had expected him to say something about the bitterness, but it was like he couldn't even taste it.

"As a doctor–"

"Trust me, I know. Don't have to tell me." Edmund smacked his lips and handed the bowl back, throwing a grin his way for good measure. "If that's all, I'm gonna sleep. You go back to doing whatever you were doing, I'm sure that was probably important or whatever. Elsa _did_ entrust you with a lot."

Saul nodded, leaving Edmund and returning to his room without another word.

If the foolish boy refused his advice, Saul wasn't keen to push. It was no concern of his whether or not Edmund was healthy, only that he appeared that way. Saul had long since come to terms with the fact that he cared nothing for any of his brothers, and continuing to pretend that there was anything more between them, save for the bond of blood, was ridiculous. Chance had brought them together. It was chance also that pitted them against each other, but Saul refused to gamble on his fate.

Without the Sorcerer, his place in the game was no longer cemented. So much for having his ways of disappearing. But, Saul thought with vicious satisfaction, he really _had_ disappeared, quite permanently. Gustaf had left behind a power vacuum for him to claim, but influence over the others meant nothing in the grand scheme of things. Not without the power of the crown backing his authority. Just like Edmund had said, Elsa was the way to power. Saul needed a new form of insurance now, some way to make sure he would stay relevant.

Maybe it was time to send a message.

His trip to Edmund's room had not been without reward.

Saul crumpled up Anna's note and threw it in a fire. Opening his window, he sent out a carrier pigeon, watching its path north until it vanished into the white horizon.
