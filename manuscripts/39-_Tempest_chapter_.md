**Chapter 39: Release, Let Free**

Night had passed, and the morning sun rose once more. Its harsh light just barely cut through the thick stormclouds, but offered no relief from cold. Reflected off a canvas of snow, the sun's light only blinded.

It was that sight which welcomed those curious enough to venture outside and marvel at the strange occurrence earlier that night.

No one in the Southern Isles could miss the outpouring of magic from the castle. An errant shockwave pulsed through the tower of ice and carried through the kingdom, passing over the skin like a chill wind, or a current of electricity. Not enough to hurt, but enough to jolt anyone out of their dreams. If any of the curious had looked up at the behemoth construction, they would have seen the flash of white light flaring out through every pane of the diamond tower. If they were truly observant, they might see the light refracted into subtle multicolor through the ice.

Still, despite the signs, the circumstances were still a mystery.

Until bells rung from every tower and every spire, and the princes knew exactly what had transpired.

It was a ritual that hadn't been followed since their father fell into deep sleep.

Every morning, the bells would chime, starting with the one farthest outward from the castle, located in the archway of the gates. One by one, the rest of the bells would follow, spreading outwards from the gates to the two towers of the front castle walls, and then the two towers at the back walls, before moving inwards to the two at the back of the actual castle; and then they would wrap around again, two more towers at the front, inwards and around, inwards and around, moving to the center of the castle.

Each bell added its own distinctive pitch to the chorus. By the toll of the final bell, all the princes were to be present in the throne room, ready to participate in their court politics, ready to give their opinion on whatever matters might be most pressing. It was partly training, and partly an exercise in control. Because, most importantly…

They were to be ready to receive King Markus.

"What's this…ruckus?"

Any commotion in the court died within a second. Almost six years had passed but no one could forget the voice of iron, the voice that not only seized authority but demanded obedience. At the familiar sound, every prince stiffened and snapped to attention. Markus strode past his sons, Elsa following behind. While Markus never spared the princes a second glance, Elsa noticed they were almost as unbreathing as herself. Every click of her heels on the stone floor resounded like a dying heartbeat.

Markus stopped just before the steps of the dais where the throne resided and, back facing towards the court, spread his arms wide. Elsa stepped closer and slid on his coat, sliding on the right arm first and then straightening the back, so that the small silver-embossed phoenix, strikingly contrasting on the black fabric, became evident. She backed away as Markus cricked his neck to adjust the wide collar, and then he took the last few steps up the dais until he stood at the throne.

And whirled around in a mechanical motion.

All nine princes fell to one knee with their heads bowed, eyes fixed on the floor and nowhere else. Even Hans; Alek had forfeited his spot at the front and was bracing the younger prince at the back of the line. For the first time in years, Elsa knelt at the level of the brothers, between their two rows; but she kept her head raised. Standing at the dais, Markus gazed down with ice-blue eyes, searching through their ranks. When he looked past her, Elsa tilted her head just enough to look out the corner of her eye – Edmund was right behind, keeping his expression carefully neutral.

Markus finally sat down, and only then did the princes rise to their feet.

"Come, Elsa. Your place is at my side." Markus gestured, and Elsa slowly ascended the steps of the dais. She had done so many times now, but never to stand. Being free of the throne was a welcome relief.

It was never comfortable. Elsa had always sat with rigid posture, back straight and arms lying flat on the rests. But Markus possessed a force of presence that she never managed to learn. She was dangerous, yes, but removed, too distant to pose a threat. Where Elsa sat all the way back, Markus kept further forward on the throne, body held at a slight bend and muscles coiled as though ready to lunge.

"It has been many years, since I last sat here and looked upon you all," Markus said, face carved from stone. "And yet none of you look the slightest bit pleased to see me."

"We welcome you back wholeheartedly, Father," Cyrus said quickly, and some of the others – Fabian, Rafael, Oliver – hurried to agree. "We have sorely missed your presence."

"It pleases me that I have been in your thoughts," Markus said, expression never wavering. "But for what purpose was my presence so sorely missed?"

Cyrus looked taken aback, and for a moment he stood dumbly as though numbed by frostbite, or afflicted with heatstroke. Saul stepped forward, and Elsa noted that since their last conversation, he had regained his poise. Everyone else was still thrown by Markus, but Saul was every bit as at ease as the commoner facing his crown-less father.

"Familial bond," Saul said. "It is not so unusual that we should think of our father during his absence. But we aren't as the common, who reveal their hand without a thought. I admit to competition within us, but that need not be a vice at all. Competition pushes us forward, and your presence, Father, drives us to be our best. It is only stagnation we fear, though, of course, Elsa has led us well."

It took every ounce of self-control for Elsa to not raise an eyebrow.

"Fanciful words…but well said, Saul." Markus chuckled, the rustle of dead reeds on a dry river bank. Saul directed his gaze downward again, eyes glinting with satisfaction. "Where are the rest of the thirteen?"

"Dead," Fabian said. Looking viciously pleased, he nodded his head towards Elsa. "Has she not told you? She killed Alvard, and Tobias. Nobody even knows what happened to Reid. And then Gustaf–"

Markus jerked his head with a guttural bark of displeasure, and Fabian promptly clamped his mouth shut. "Your incompetence is becoming most taxing," Markus said, lip curling. "Did you really think I did not know? Blame no one but yourselves, and the traitorous instinct you all seem to harbor."

Fabian dropped to the floor, on all fours, and the others followed with perhaps slightly more dignity. At least, Saul looked no less comfortable, and Alek retained his prideful expression. But the others, less secure in their worth – Cyrus, whose only value came from being born before the rest; Stefan, whose art had never been appreciated; Oliver, whose inventions were seen as frivolous – looked sick with fear. It was a primal thing, undisguisable. Elsa had seen the same look before when conquering kingdoms, killing. It was the face of mortal men who, before the moment of death, realized the futility of their life.

Had Markus's sons always feared him this way? Elsa watched the proceedings, fighting to avoid frowning or furrowing her brow, or any sign that would give away her thoughts.

"Fabian and Cyrus, always at the beck and call of their eldest brother," Markus spat. "Did I not already make known that Gustaf was no longer my heir? So why, then, did you two advocate his rule? Was I in any way unclear that _Elsa_ was to be in charge of my affairs?"

"N-No, Father," Cyrus said.

"We were only wary that she had stolen the throne through trickery!" Fabian cried. "We had no way of communicating with you, our own father, and anything she said could have been a lie–"

"Silence!" Markus slammed the throne's arm and Fabian fell silent, his face deathly pale. "So then you doubt _my_ ability, that I would be so easily deceived – I can assure you, wretch, that the atrophied husk that you call your brain was _not_ inherited from _me_."

Partly through the scolding, Rafael had snickered. Markus now bore down on him with a baleful stare, and his sneer was gone as quickly as it came. Music was of no interest to his father.

"As for Stefan and Rafael," Markus continued, "I have decreed, time and time again, that your efforts be placed in some _worthwhile_ activity, not those foolish pursuits you dare to call the arts. Nothing but naïve fantasies, the immature works of children dithering in the mud. Did you take my absence as permission to waste away your lives? In that case, I see no reason for your presence here."

Everyone looked ill, not just Stefan and Rafael, and Elsa understood at last the underlying fear they all possessed. Exile, to Baaj. Gustaf may have had immunity, but the threat still hung over their heads like the edge of a guillotine. Elsa was reminded again that Markus had once banished Ina and Odon, and that they had died. Gustaf may have deserved that fate, but his wife and child had been innocent…

Elsa put the thought aside. Regardless, the fault lay with Gustaf for his betrayal. She had no sympathy for traitors, and less so for cowards who displaced punishment onto family.

Markus turned his attention to Saul and, after a brief moment of consideration, inclined his head. "Well done, Saul. As expected of my son."

"Oliver was of assistance," Saul said.

Elsa looked to the tenth prince, who appeared relieved when Markus nodded. Ironic that this was most likely the reason _Reid_ had followed Saul. It was too bad he was no longer here to reap the reward.

"And Alek…" Markus frowned, but Alek did not prostrate himself like the rest, instead continuing to meet his father's eyes. Elsa was impressed by his poise, when the others before had been so afraid. "You are as defiant as ever, an admirable trait – but preposterously misplaced. Was Alvard's approval so important to you that you would flout my command and act in opposition to Elsa?"

Elsa saw Alek's involuntary reaction, the hitch in his breath. Covered up again as soon as it appeared, of course, but it was there, the weak joint in his armor. "I admit that I was...stubborn," Alek said.

"A sign of a weak mind, to let others think for you," Markus snapped. "And an even worse offense because you were always _better_ than Alvard, yet still you yielded to him."

"I'm not better–"

"You could be, if only you strived to leave his shadow." When Markus spoke this time, harshening voice an ugly, ugly thing, Alek flinched. "Comfort yourself, perhaps, but basking in mediocrity is beneath you!"

"Alek isn't mediocre."

All eyes turned to the back of the court.

Even Elsa was surprised by the small but firm voice daring to interrupt Markus; Hans, looking pitifully weak while seated in a wheelchair, didn't waver at the scrutiny. Elsa just now noticed something different about the way he spoke. She had once loathed his voice, the sinuous quality of his baritone a paper-thin disguise for deceit. Condescension had dripped from every word he spoke, and Elsa could imagine him saying that same sentence before – _Alek isn't mediocre_ – and following with some backhanded comment – _Alek is already trying his best, Alek will learn from his mistakes –_ but now, no longer. Without that edge, Hans was…agreeable.

Markus leaned forward, neck craning to get a better look at Hans. If Markus shared her respect, it was lost on Elsa. One glance at the crippled legs and his lips pursed. "Do continue. If you think I am _wrong_, then I will hear your words."

"Alek has done more for the Southern Isles than any of us," Hans said. At his side, Alek motioned vainly for him to stop. "If not for him, countless more would be dead, taken from their homes and tortured."

"Ahh, yes…your exploits together have made you close." Markus drew back, slowly. "Though does it not sting, Hans, that you were the one to be so debilitated?"

"I intended to die," Hans said, lips curving into a smile.

"...Were you not afraid?" Markus asked. Not often was he surprised, but his voice contained a fervent element, as though the thought of _intending_ to die was both unthinkable and yet horribly fascinating.

"No, I looked forward to resting; I thought that was bravery…but that was just as cowardly as clinging to life without purpose." At those words, muscles twitched in Markus's jaw. Edmund, too, who had been looking down the whole time, glanced over. "Alek and Anna came back for me, and they stayed with me. I'm grateful that I can be here today…and that I can let go of self-pity, and be something better."

Elsa had watched him as he spoke, but Hans ended his speech by looking not at Markus, but at her, and she wondered if that was intentional. When they made eye contact, he nodded, soft smile returning. It _was_ because of what she said to him once, then.

"I think," Elsa said quietly, "Alek and Hans are both worthy of praise."

At once, Elsa received incredulous glances from all the princes. She would have _enjoyed_ watching them be berated, once. After suffering all their plotting and disapproval, she thought she would have taken pleasure in watching Markus break their self-righteousness. But, now that the time was here for her long-awaited deliverance, Elsa found that she did not. She was _tired_ of this wordplay. She was _tired_ of constantly being on edge. She didn't understand why Markus felt the need to chastise each of his sons.

Elsa had never been under any illusion that Markus was loving, not like how Agdar was with Anna. Markus had high expectations, and he was stern, strict, ungenerous with his affection. When she was still a child, Elsa had often found herself wishing, after rigorous training without a hint of mercy, that Markus could be the father who showered her with attention. Coaxing even a smile from him was a momentous task, and praise was as rare as summer snow; but she had believed that Markus _did_ love, underneath the cold exterior.

It scared her to find herself thinking otherwise.

Markus looked over at her, frowning. Elsa rather felt like he was pondering a puzzle.

"…You're right, of course," Markus said, motioning for the princes to rise. "It seems that, in my disappointment, I may have been overly harsh." Murmurs to the contrary arose, but they quieted once Markus held up his hand. "No, I make no excuses. It pained me that my children fought amongst themselves, and allowed this fortunate fate, which binds us together as family, to fall into disarray."

"We will follow Hans' example, then, and learn from our mistakes," Saul said, not quite bowing, but he inclined his head at his estranged brother, and the others followed his lead. Alek squeezed Hans' arm.

Elsa relaxed, relieved that the atmosphere had calmed somewhat. She was being unreasonable, paranoid just like Anna used to joke about – but best not to think about Anna at the moment, best to keep her thoughts in the present. It wasn't so surprising that Markus had not yet adjusted after his long sleep. Anyone would be disoriented, and couldn't that cause unpredictable moods?

"Now that you all understand my expectations–!" Markus cut off mid-sentence, doubling over and breaking into hacking coughs. Even behind the cover of his hand the wet noise of rising blood and phlegm was audible, and every time he tried to contain them, the coughs only redoubled. Elsa knew better than to try and assist. She held up her hand for the rest to stay where they were. After taking long breaths, Markus straightened, eyes red-rimmed and watery.

"Father, you need to rest–"

"I have rested enough," Markus bit out, but the pain was obvious in his drawn face. "We have much to discuss, much work to be done…"

Another round of coughs erupted, stronger than the last. Scorch marks burned onto the throne's arm where Markus clenched the stone, and this time, he waved his free hand to dismiss the princes. After reading the dismissal in his glance, Elsa, too, stepped down from the dais. When she passed Saul, she murmured, "Stay and look after Markus." Saul nodded, and Elsa continued on her way.

She'd looked forward to this reunion, this reprieve, for years.

She thought she'd be happier.

* * *

In the Great Hall, Elsa was surprised to see Edmund waiting.

"Hey, Sis!" Edmund waved and kicked off the wall he had been leaning on, bounding toward her with a hop, skip, and a jump. "I was wondering if you maybe wanted to play some chess. Been a while, huh?"

"It…has been," Elsa said.

At one time, Elsa would have found some excuse to say no, if not simply refused outright. Not because she disliked Edmund. On the contrary, he was one of the few she trusted, even after – or perhaps especially because of – the debacle with Gustaf. But Elsa had once believed that she liked to be alone. She would have thought retreating to her quarters and drowning herself in work, or training, or any other distraction was better. Now, though, silence just reminded her of what – _who_ – was missing.

"Uhh, Sis…?"

"Lead the way," Elsa said.

Edmund grinned and did just that, taking her down the hall to the princes' wing. Last time she was here, Elsa realized, she had destroyed Edmund's door. She wondered if she should apologize, or if mentioning that incident would just make everything awkward all over again. Anna would probably bring it up, trip over her words while blurting out an apology, and manage to smooth things over by sheer force of personality. Elsa doubted she could manage half as well.

Once they arrived in the common area, Elsa was surprised to see a chessboard already laid out on the table. She sent a questioning glance Edmund's way.

"Oh, I come out here and play by myself when I have trouble sleeping," Edmund explained, collapsing on the sofa facing the entryway. Scooting over closer to the fireplace placed strategically between the two couches, he warmed his hands. "I was actually playing right before the bells started ringing."

"Does that happen…often?" Elsa asked, claiming the other seat.

Edmund only smiled into the flames, but that was answer enough. Elsa could understand, having suffered enough nightmares and restless nights to last her a lifetime. Both of them had the same weariness in their eyes, the same forced energy that was stretched tight.

"All right! Let's get started," Edmund said. He had already begun to arrange the white pieces before pausing and looking up guiltily. "Oh, shoot, sorry. Mind if I'm White?"

"Go ahead," Elsa said. She preferred White too, but Edmund had always been fixated on exclusively playing White. She could be flexible.

"So I'm not trying to grill you or anything, but…" Edmund sent a pawn forward. Elsa watched him warily, unsure if this whole outing was only a charade to ask about Markus. "Have you ever thought about opening a clothing store?"

Not quite what she had been expecting.

"…What?"

"Think about it!" Edmund waved his second pawn around, making gestures that Elsa assumed was a poor impersonation of her magic. "You can make fabric, right? It would be crazy good for the economy."

"Edmund, we don't _have_ an economy anymore," Elsa said. "Not to mention no one would want clothing made out of ice. I'm the only one who can wear them."

"Oh. It's just that I remember Anna wearing that one dress…"

Elsa stiffened, distracting herself by immediately moving a piece after Edmund set his pawn down. "Well, she was the exception."

"Was?" Edmund sobered. Several turns passed in silence before he spoke again, bishop crossing two spaces. "Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up…well, you know."

"It's fine."

Silence again, broken only by the crackling of the fireplace. Truthfully, Elsa still felt uncomfortable being close to one. Every now and then, her gaze flickered towards the flames, and inevitably she remembered the repressed memory of her parents, and fire searing her skin. She rubbed the back of her hand, and looked up. Edmund was still fidgeting, frowning intensely as he stared at the board.

"Really," Elsa said, smiling when Edmund jumped. "I told you, I'm fine."

"I'm sure everything will work itself out in the end," Edmund said, grinning weakly again at the sight of her smile. "Just as long as you have hope."

"You really…remind me of Anna," Elsa admitted.

"She told me once to have faith, and that really stuck with me."

Several more moves passed, and now that the air seemed cleared between them, Elsa put more attention into the game. Edmund had arranged his pieces into a strange formation she had never seen before, seemingly pointless. "What kind of opening are you using?"

"Huh?" Edmund looked down and, after studying the board, groaned. "Damn. Yeah, I didn't actually mean to do that. Whoops."

"Do you want to restart?"

"Nah, I'll keep going."

If Edmund was willing to forgo his first-move advantage with a failed opening, Elsa wasn't going to complain. While he lingered over his next move, chewing on his lip and apparently thinking of a way to salvage the situation, Elsa debated whether or not she should divulge how Markus asked after him. If it might be helpful, she supposed, she ought to tell him.

"When I woke Markus, he specifically asked me about you," Elsa said, eyebrows rising when Edmund paused midway through moving his knight. "I'm not sure why, but I just thought you should know."

"Lucky he passed over me during the whole dressing-down thing, then."

After Elsa moved her own knight to defend, Edmund advanced a pawn. She had no idea what he was planning, if he was even planning anymore. It drove away her knight, but there didn't seem to be any offensive value in the move. Nothing was threatening her position at all. Elsa took his bishop handily.

"And you have no idea why he asked about you?" Elsa continued.

"I'm as confused as you are," Edmund said, and then, "Checkmate."

Confused, Elsa looked down. Without her noticing, Edmund had advanced his queen to the h-file, cornering her king. She looked for any moves that she could make, but Edmund was right. She was completely blocked off, and now she saw the cleverness of his play. Even though he had never posed a _direct_ threat, he had always been positioning his pieces in the best possible location for a decisive attack.

"…I lost."

"The Stonewall Attack," Edmund explained. "But I'm sure you would have noticed if you weren't so distracted. It's the only way I can win against you, I think."

"You're selling yourself short. It was impressive," Elsa said.

"Best two out of three?"

"Doesn't the loser usually request that, and not the victor?"

Both of them tilted their heads at the same time.

Edmund smiled. Before he could say anything more, they were interrupted by heavy footsteps. Where he was seated, Edmund only had to look up; Elsa twisted around, and saw Markus approaching. Midway between the archway and where they were seated, he paused. Apparently he had been so focused on his youngest son that he missed her presence entirely.

"Your presence here surprises me, Elsa," Markus said.

"We were playing chess," Elsa said, gesturing towards the board. "If you wanted to speak with Edmund, I can leave and come back once you two are done."

"…No, that will be unnecessary." Markus moved toward the windows, staring out into the snow with his back turned toward them and arms held at the base of his spine. "It occurred to me…that I might have been thoughtless. I never even thought to speak to you, Edmund."

"Yeah, but our group meeting pretty much covered everything," Edmund said. Sitting between them, Elsa adjusted to observe both father and son.

"Perhaps," Markus said, lingering over the last syllable. Carefully watching out of the corner of his eye, he added, "Though I was concerned you would be…distraught…about Gustaf's passing."

Edmund smiled tightly, rubbing the white queen between his thumb and index. "But I don't understand. Why would you be worried about only me…Father?"

"Of course, all of us grieve for him. But I realize you two were particularly close," Markus said. Elsa noticed how he continued to keep watch on Edmund, and it was just the way he had taught her, once, to read people. Offer tiny tidbits of information in exchange for what you wanted, gauge reactions to certain reveals, and file them away for analysis. "Gustaf cared for you, more than he did anyone."

"I'll be fine. We were close, but this is just the way things needed to happen." Edmund set the queen down, watching Markus in much the same way as the king watched him. "But, you were close to Gustaf also. It must hurt you too."

"Ahh. Yes, I suppose." Markus moved his hands to the front, out of their view, and Elsa nearly frowned. It was unlike him to be so cautious. "I remember when he was only a squirming babe, and my feelings then…my feelings. They worm their way into our lives… and they could be anything, perhaps."

"…Yeah. Maybe."

"Gustaf was not as I hoped." Markus turned entirely, and smiled. "But no more of these sad things. Back to you, Edmund. Have I ever told you how much you resemble your mother?"

"Just a few times," Edmund said.

Elsa had only seen a portrait of Edmund's mother once, an obscure woman who had died during childbirth, and there was little record of her anywhere. From what she remembered, they looked nothing alike. In fact, Edmund looked nothing like Markus, or even any of his twelve brothers.

"I _am_ sorry I have never told you much about her," Markus said.

"I've never wondered much about my mother," Edmund said. Markus seemed quite alarmed when he rose from his seat, and even Elsa watched with some trepidation when he approached Markus. "I'd rather appreciate what's in front of me. I'm glad that I have my father here again."

Before Markus could react, Edmund hugged him.

Elsa smiled at the sight. Edmund had buried his face in his father's chest, and Markus looked uncertain of how to react. He held his arms stiffly in the air, eyes widened with incredulous panic, so Elsa nodded encouragingly. Even then, Markus didn't react. Some spasm of conflict passed through his face, the stony features rendering themselves vulnerable for a brief, brief instant.

"Yes," Markus whispered. "I suppose I can start over with you."

Finally, Markus closed his arms around Edmund, smoothing his hair with one hand.

Elsa smiled, and left them alone.

It was a warming sight.
