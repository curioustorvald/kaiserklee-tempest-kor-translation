**Chapter 20: Day One, 72 Hours Remain**

Elsa had spent less than two months with Anna, but years with the royal family. It was an easy thing to put on her best thespian performance: a regal stance of royal authority and a face trained to a blank canvas, revealing none of the turmoil she felt inside. She couldn't allow them to see even the smallest hint of weakness, or they might seize on the opportunity left in her wake even more fervently than they already would. It was as comfortable as switching masks and Elsa wondered, vaguely, if this was truly a mask at all. Maybe the face she wore with _Anna_ was the mask.

"Weselton will fall," Elsa announced. "In my absence, I leave Prince Saul in charge."

A murmur of surprise rippled from the assembled princes, not from her first statement but the second. She had never once left anyone in charge, preferring to allow them free reign on her expeditions. The brothers acted as checks on one another well enough, and a few days of contained chaos was far preferable to raising any one above the others. But times were different. She needed someone to act as a pillar, and she could trust no one but Saul to have the necessary fortitude.

"Why Eight?" Fabian demanded. "Anyone would be better, and Gustaf has more right than any of us. Just because you two had a _thing_–"

"You should shut your mouth before speaking of things you know nothing about," Alek snarled. Elsa was surprised that he would defend her, but she supposed Anna did have a way with people, even ones as obdurate as Alek. Still, she was more curious about how Saul would handle this.

"If you speak of right, then no one has greater right than the Queen to appoint her successor," Saul said, calmly and easily. At his heart, he was a born-natural in the court. "And, by your courtesy, don't drag my esteemed brother into your idiocy. I'm sure Gustaf bears no grudge. Am I correct?"

"Of course," Gustaf said. "You are my younger brother by fully shared blood. It would be ungracious of me to do otherwise, Saul."

Sometimes Elsa forgot they shared a mother; Saul looked nothing like Gustaf, resembling their mother just as much as Gustaf resembled Markus. But it was clever of Saul to use that to his advantage. Fabian was forced to swallow his outrage, Cyrus offered a few platitudes to apologize on his behalf, and the potentially tricky matter was closed.

"If any others have disagreements, speak them now. Do not stir troubles in my absence," Elsa said. "I would not have your numbers dwindle any further."

"We're good!" Edmund said, giving her a thumbs-up. When Elsa made no outward response, he did not appear at all discouraged, instead grinning sheepishly when Fabian scoffed.

"I will serve to my utmost ability," Saul said, bowing with one hand placed over his heart. "Godspeed, Queen Elsa. May Nola speed your sails, and by the Grace of Lenus, may you return victorious."

"Not quite yet," Elsa said, and Saul paused. "I have no need for the blessing of pagan gods. On the other hand, I would like to borrow Oliver."

At once all the princes stilled, though Elsa had to hide a frown when she saw Gustaf smiling knowingly. Even Hans looked puzzled, but Gustaf alone seemed to understand. Oliver stepped forward, looking shaken, but one glance from Saul and he calmed. After taking a deep breath, he bowed. "Your Majesty?"

"I've heard that you are an able strategist. If you are willing," Elsa said, tone brokering no argument despite the geniality of her words, "I would have you join me to offer your counsel."

"I-I'm afraid my capability has been greatly exaggerated, I would be of little use–"

"Oliver would be happy to go," Saul interrupted, and even without her raised view from the throne, Elsa would have been hard-pressed to miss the warning in his voice. "Isn't that right?"

"Of course," Oliver said. "I meant no offense. I was only afraid I would disappoint, but I will endeavor to meet your expectations, Your Majesty."

Elsa nodded and rose from her throne, and immediately all the princes – some more grudgingly than others – bent to one knee with their heads down. "You are all dismissed. Oliver, meet me at the docks in half an hour." At her dismissal they rose and slowly stepped back, though still half-bowed and without turning away from her. Only past the doorway could they move as usual, but Elsa's gaze zeroed in on one particular prince. "A moment of your time, Hans."

Barely missing a beat, Hans stopped in his tracks. Elsa was impressed by his poise. Not once he did react to the half-questioning, half-gleeful gazes of the others, some curious and others certain he would be punished in some way. Instead, Hans kept his eyes fixed on hers in wordless challenge. Once his brothers had exited, Hans walked closer.

"Is there something else you needed, Your Majesty?"

Elsa abandoned caution. She rushed forward with the wind at the heels, faster than Hans could ever hope to react to, and before he could blink twice she had her hand wrapped around his throat. It took all the control she had to rein in her ice, but even still, she knew her skin had to be freezing to the touch. Hans widened his eyes, but he offered no resistance. That would just give her an excuse. She sorely wished he _would_ try something.

"If you try anything, even _think_ about hurting Anna," Elsa hissed, "I promise you that no power in any world will ever stop me from killing you. There will be no sanctuary for you, no place you can hide where I will not find you. Am I understood?"

Hans jerked his head in the best approximation of a nod that he could manage. Elsa released him, shoving him away so roughly that he stumbled backwards and nearly fell to the floor. Only an ungraceful flail kept him on his feet. The instant he regained his footing Hans clutched his throat, shaking fingers pulling his collar outward as far as it would go. Though Hans held back his coughs, Elsa could see that he was desperate for air.

"Are you sure that I should be the one you're so wary of?" Hans asked.

Elsa had thought so, but when faced with her attack, Hans had done nothing. If he were the Sorcerer, Elsa had expected him to lash out on instinct. It should have been reflex to do _something_, and yet Hans had left himself defenseless. Was she wrong, then? Or was he simply controlled enough to hide himself?

"You are the only one who might be foolish enough to try," Elsa said.

Who else could it be…?

"Then you should know that I am no threat to you." Hans fixed his collar and straightened out his coat, no longer thrown but composed as usual. "I will not harm Anna. That, I can promise you."

There was something about the way he said it. Elsa trusted Hans as little as she would trust a blade hanging over her neck, but for once she did not doubt him. There was no duplicity in his voice that she could discern, and she had known him for years and years, played this game for almost as long. Maybe she was overconfident, but she thought she would be able to tell if he were lying.

"See to it that you do not."

Elsa left without another glance back.

* * *

Anna watched from the battlements as the fleet left, the strengthened hulls of ice-breakers smashing a path for the other ships to follow. She supposed she could have gone to the docks, but there was little reason to when Elsa needed to maintain her aloof image. They had already said their goodbyes. All she could do now was wait. At the head of the fleet was a single ship crafted entirely of ice, a ship Anna was familiar with as both the one that had headed the assault on Arendelle and the one that had brought Elsa to her. How strange it was…

"Huh. Not too often I see you looking so thoughtful."

Anna turned around and saw Alek approaching, looking not exactly friendly – she would be surprised if the blond twat was ever _not_ scowling – but maybe a tad bit softer than he usually did. She gave him her biggest smile and he rolled his eyes, leaning against the castle walls next to her.

"So, are you calling me an airhead?" Anna asked.

"You said it, not me." Alek waved a hand before Anna could protest and added, "Elsa asked me to watch over you. I would have done it anyway, but I'm impressed she would ask. Guess she does care for you."

"What, something made you think otherwise?"

"No, I just didn't think she could, but…well. It's easy to care about you. I know I do," Alek said. Anna looked at him carefully and was shocked to see a smile small curling at the edge of his lips. It might have been her imagination but he looked the slightest bit disappointed. "Don't take this the wrong way."

"I'll take it the way you want me to," Anna said.

"Friends, then." Alek extended a hand. When Anna took it, feeling a little befuddled by the strange formality of it all, Alek laughed and shook her hand with a vigor that left her reeling. "So then, back on topic before you distract me again. From what I've seen, Elsa is treating you well."

Anna frowned, shaking her hand around to get the feeling back into her fingers. Stupid blond didn't know his own strength. "From what you've seen?"

"I've spent hours spying on you two in the study. You know, from the courtyard. Pretty good view through the windows from there," Alek said, shrugging his shoulders while Anna gaped. "I had to make sure she wasn't doing anything indecent to you. Guess I was wrong. She seems…courteous enough."

"Uhh, I'm happy you think so? But that's a little creepy." Anna smacked him upside the head, silently thanking whatever gods existed that Alek had no idea about the things she and Elsa did _elsewhere_. Mostly at her insistence. Alek apparently had a thick skull because he barely reacted to the hit, only laughing quietly at her feeble efforts. "Seriously! It's not okay to stalk us," Anna grumbled.

"Please, you two are so obvious that I'd have to make an effort to not notice. And honestly, it's a little _too_ obvious," Alek said, sobering in the blink of an eye. "Listen, Anna. You're not going to like this, but as a friend, I have to say it anyway."

Something about his tone set off warning bells in her head. "All right," Anna said, nodding and mentally bracing herself. Maybe he _did_ know. She would just have to call him out for being a stalker again–

"How long do you intend to keep this going? Whatever it is you have with Elsa?" Alek frowned when Anna just blinked. "Have you ever considered that this might never lead to anything?"

"What do you mean? Of course it will. It already _has_. You said it yourself that Elsa cares about me," Anna said.

"But she can't ever give you a proper title. It's impossible for you two to be officially together," Alek stressed. Releasing a loud sigh when Anna said nothing, Alek ran a hand through his hair and looked away, clenching his jaw angrily. "Just think for a second. What are you considered now? Are you still a prisoner of war, or are you Elsa's consort? You're technically just a prisoner, sure, but do you think anyone would dare do _anything_ to you? You may as well be our master, but the thing is that you're _not_ and everything's all muddled and unclear."

"Why does that matter? I'm happy just being here with Elsa–"

"Goddamnit, Anna," Alek hissed. "You deserve more than to be some trophy she keeps around!"

That was too much. Alek had no idea what he was talking about, and even if Anna was fine with him misunderstanding her, now he was insulting Elsa too in one fell swoop. Without thinking twice Anna slapped him across the face with all her strength, and unlike her playful hit last time, Alek's head whipped to the side. The resounding smack rang terribly loud in the silence of the battlement. Once the echo faded, it was even quieter. Only after the fact did Anna realize what she had done.

"I-I'm sorry," Anna stammered. She drew her hand back against her chest, trying to control her breathing.

"It's fine, I was out of line. I'll leave now," Alek said. When he turned away, more than likely to leave – not that she could blame him – Anna grabbed onto his arm with both her hands. When Alek looked back, Anna winced at the red print across his face. She had hit him harder than she thought.

"Just hear me out, all right? I know what I said sounded stupid, but I've thought about this," Anna said, letting go of the blond. Alek crossed his arms and Anna continued, "Even if I don't know where this is going, I have to do it anyway. Does that make sense? I just have to."

At length, Alek uncrossed his arms and sighed. "Fine, I can't tell you what to do. I just hope you know what you're doing. Not like I can give you any advice, I'm not some sort of relationship guru."

Anna was relieved to hear the edge leave his voice, the horribly forced formality that suited Alek as little as it did Anna reverting back to his usual ease. "But aren't you still trying to be?"

Alek snorted and rubbed at his face, but he had to smack Anna's hand away when she reached out to poke her handprint. "Stop that. It hurts enough without you messing with it."

"I'm sorry! It just happened." Anna grinned sheepishly as Alek rolled his eyes. "So other than giving me relationship advice, don't you have anything better to do?"

"Of course, I can't forget my charge from Elsa," Alek said. "I've been looking into this Sorcerer, but I've found _nothing_. It's a little uncanny how good he is at hiding his tracks. I don't want it to be true…but I'm sure that he has to be one of us. There's no other way he could manage all this so meticulously."

"Are there no leads at all?" Anna asked.

"I hardly know where to start. I've just been ransacking Tobias's room, but there's nothing that might help. Definitely nothing about magic."

"And you haven't thought about…" Anna bit her lip. What she was about to say might have been insensitive, but for the life of her she couldn't think of any way to word it delicately. That had never been her strong point. "You know, about Alvard. Have you…been to his room?"

Alek pursed his lips, biting out reluctantly, "No."

"...Should we go?"

"Go on your own, I don't want to."

Anna put her hands on her hips. "Now you're just being stubborn. So I guess you're just being yourself, but seriously–"

"Look, Anna, I…" Alek threw his hands onto the railing and released a weary sigh. "I know that's the logical thing, I really do. But going there, I can't, I just…I can't."

Anna approached slowly, and then laid her hand on Alek's back. "If you want to do something for Alvard, you have to find his killer," Anna said. Alek stilled, but she could see him looking at her out the corner of his eye and she knew the cogs were running in his mind. "You can't avoid it forever."

"…Is that a challenge?" Alek turned with an uneasy grin, and even if it was obviously forced, Anna was glad to see it. There was a flicker of fight in his eyes now that had been missing before.

"You think I can't drag you there?" Anna fumed when Alek only raised an eyebrow and straightened, looming a full foot taller than her and casting a shadow over her entire person. "This doesn't change a thing."

"All right, I give up. Let's just go." Without waiting for a reply, Alek strolled down the steps of the castle walls. "Any time this century, Anna. I know you're short, but try to keep up."

"What the–" Anna gaped when Alek vanished around the corner before she could even begin to give chase. "Hey! Make up your mind!"

She ran full-speed.

* * *

Alvard's room was kept as it always was, though black cowls had been draped over the furnishings and nearly everything was coated in a thin layer of dust. No one came in here to clean, not when the door was sealed; Alek had needed to draw his sword to hack down the lock, and while Anna was impressed by the show of unnecessary violence, she did back away from his manic swings. Alek strode through the door and glanced around the room with disgust.

"I should have come sooner. Look at this," Alek said, scowling as per usual, so Anna ignored him in favor of taking a closer look around.

Standard fare all around: massive bed, dresser, polished-looking desk, though there was a grindstone placed to the side and the wall was lined with an assortment of weapons ranging from swords and battle-axes to spears and flails. Compared to Saul, Alvard's room was much less polished, certainly no intricate teacups and sculptures. And dust everywhere, of course, even on the carpet.

"Nobody else has been here, unless they can float," Alek said, pointing down to the footprint-less floor. "Though I wouldn't be surprised anymore if that were the case."

"So should we just look around?" Anna asked.

"I guess. This was your idea."

Anna swallowed a retort in favor of observing the weapons. A rack with four swords slotted vertically side by side. She raised a hand to tap the flat side of a broadsword, surprised by the clear ring it emitted.

"Alvard always kept them in perfect condition," Alek explained, but his fond grin turned into a frown when he walked closer. "Except this one looks…" Anna watched as Alek withdrew the third one, a longsword, and gave it a test swing. "Half-sharpened. Strange for two reasons."

"You lost me."

"There's no reason for it to be dulled, I had no idea Alvard was in any sort of conflict and none of these are training swords," Alek explained. "And _half_-sharpened? That can't be right."

"Well, you guys patrolled, right? Even outside in the town? Maybe he had to stop something and it was minor so you just didn't know about it," Anna said.

Alek laughed. "Have you looked outside recently? We barely have crime, so nothing to stop. Almost no one has the gall to try anything. Really, Alvard insisted on patrols just because of tradition. Oh, but we have assassins coming for Elsa now and then. Usually we just turn a blind eye."

Anna scowled. "I've been meaning to say something about that. You grew up with her, and you let people try to kill her?"

"Like they could. You haven't seen everything she can do. Assassins are just target practice for Elsa. Or, well, more like ants," Alek said, fiddling with the sword a moment longer. When the silence stretched on, he looked back at Anna and shrugged. "All right, I'm sorry. It was petty, but most of us thought the worst when she proclaimed herself queen and started an _eternal winter_."

"Whatever," Anna muttered. "So there's something weird here. Good. We're getting somewhere."

"Barely." Alek stooped down at Alvard's desk and tried to slide open the drawer, only for it to remain closed. Subsequent tries led to the same result, the drawer rattling again and again.

"Maybe you should find a key," Anna suggested.

"No need. I came prepared." Alek reached into his coat and withdrew a piece of wire, and to Anna's amazement, he jammed it into the keyhole, wriggled it around for a second, and before she knew it, Alek had slid the drawer open.

Anna bent down, shaking her head as Alek threw the wire away. "Kleptomaniac much? Who carries around wire for this exact reason? And why didn't you do that for the lock outside?"

"I can't really bust a drawer open with a sword, the lock isn't an attachment," Alek said.

"…That's the opposite of what I asked."

"I forgot I had the wire," Alek admitted, reaching in the drawer to retrieve a small leather-bound booklet. He handed it off to Anna. "Alvard kept records. We'll see if there's anything out of the ordinary here."

Anna riffled through the pages, filled with cramped writing. She skipped ahead to the end and skimmed through it. "He wrote that he talked to Hans the day before his… assassination attempt. And there's some pretty rude stuff about me, but whatever."

"It would make sense if Hans were involved," Alek said.

Anna snapped the book shut. Strangely, when she tried to hand the journal to Alek, he refused to take it and backed away like the thing was on fire. "I don't think Hans did anything," Anna said.

"I wouldn't put it past him," Alek said. "But at the same time, this is just way too obvious…"

Anna crossed her arms. "Why do all of you say that about Hans? No, really. What has he done that makes you all automatically suspect him of whatever?"

"Please. You don't know him like we do. It's in his eyes," Alek said. Anna continued staring at him, unimpressed, until Alek groaned, "Look, can we move on?"

"Fine, but we're not done talking about this."

"_Fine_," Alek said, in a way that told Anna he was very much done. "Now then, for someone who's done so much to keep hidden, this was a pretty amateur slipup. Either this is some kind of ploy to make us suspect the wrong person, or Hans is playing a double bluff. Honestly, I'm going to just suspect everyone for now."

Anna made a noncommittal hum in the back of her throat, ignoring Alek in favor of perusing the booklet in greater detail. It felt sort of sacrilege to rummage through a dead man's things and peek into his private writings, but no doubt Alek had the same thought because he refused to look into the journal. No doubt it hurt to be reminded of his brother. Anna still had no idea what to think about Alvard, torn between Alek's obviously high esteem for him and the all-too-real assassination. But if he had been under the influence of magic…

"What do you think really happened?" Anna asked.

"…Of course I want to believe that Alvard wasn't in his right mind, but–" Alek swallowed and then nodded his head at the swords, at the booklet in her hand. "What does any of this prove?"

"Maybe you should look in this," Anna said. She waved the booklet around, not sure if it was comedic or sad how Alek seemed to flinch. No. Never comedic. It was actual fear in Alek's eyes, fear that they might have been wrong and that Alvard had done everything of his own volition after all.

"I'm sure you can read just as well as I can," Alek said.

"Probably better, but problem is, you know Alvard better than me." Anna thrust the journal at Alek one more time. "I'm missing something here, I just know it. Come on. We came all this way."

Maybe a part of him had wanted to read his brother's writing, to be reminded of the brother that had taught him so much. After Alek managed to take the journal, his hands shaking, he spared no time in cracking it open. Anna sat in silence as he read, and she made no sound at all for the hour it took. She had gone straight to the end. Alek started from the beginning. It was so subtle that Anna barely noticed, but there was something less defensive Alek's stance now, a tension that slowly drained out.

At long last, Alek snapped the book shut.

"You're right. Something is wrong here," Alek said.

Before Anna could ask anything, she was interrupted by the sound of footsteps pounding so hard against the floor she could feel vibrations. Alek immediately pocketed the journal. Anna looked out the door and saw Edmund, no doubt having dashed his way up the hallway, and he skidded to a stop before powering through the door to join them, huffing and puffing from the run. When he arrived, he doubled over to breathe. Anna and Alek just stared at him as he recovered, until Edmund finally straightened.

"Saul wants us all to meet," Edmund said, pointing back with his thumbs. "Sorry, I have no idea what this is about."

"Only a few hours have passed and he has some edict for us?" Alek raised an eyebrow. "Look at him waving his new authority around."

"I thought you liked Saul," Anna said. "I mean, you _did_ take me to him that time I was hurt. Unless you think that he might be the–"

Alek cut her off with a sharp glance, eyes darting to the still-winded Edmund who seemed none the wiser about his scrutiny. Anna realized that Edmund still had no idea about the Sorcerer. It was only Elsa, Saul, Alek, and herself who knew…

"No clue," Alek said. "But you didn't see him before. Something is off about him."

"Vibes," Edmund offered. "We should go, though. Keeping him waiting seems like a bad idea." Edmund turned and left again at the same pace as he came, and before long he was out of sight.

Anna turned back to Alek. "You cannot be serious. You're even going to suspect Edmund?"

"How can you know otherwise? Everyone's a suspect, even Edmund," Alek said. When Anna rolled her eyes, Alek made a sound in the back of his throat that was suspiciously like a snarl. "You're too trusting, Anna. It could be _me_, for all you know. Here we are, all alone, I could have pushed you off the towers before or stabbed you here–"

"And I thought Elsa was paranoid. I'm not going to suspect everyone, and especially not people who have been nothing but nice to me," Anna said. She ignored Alek's groan and bounded out the room in two quick strides. Only when she was out did she look back. "Come on, we're gonna be late!"

"You're killing me," Alek said.

"If you don't hurry up!"
