**Chapter 17: Glorious Chained Wings**

It was a point of pride that he had managed to keep up his farce for so long.

Saul tried to pretend he was content simply toiling away behind the scenes without recognition, but despite his greatest efforts to placate himself, the ingenuity of his mind and the dexterity of his hands made it all too clear he deserved more. Though Saul was humble, he did not partake in false modesty. It was simple fact that he was superior to the common mold, and his belief was born not from arrogance but from the irrefutable test of time, even the testament of his brothers.

"One day you'll be king," Oliver had said many years ago, even while they were all of them secretly pining for the throne. When Saul asked him how he could be so sure, Oliver answered: "It's just something you have that the rest of us lack."

It was admittedly a surprise when Elsa was chosen over him.

But he loved Elsa and bore her no ill will. When the announcement had been made that the throne would be succeeded by none of the thirteen brothers but rather by _Elsa_, Saul supported her without reservation. Despite the objections against the impurity of her blood, Elsa would make a good queen. It was Saul who convinced Alvard against open rebellion, Saul who swayed Fabian to let the coronation pass by without incident, and Saul who again persuaded Oliver and Reid to aid him in assisting Elsa.

Yet still, Elsa was cold to him. It had been sudden. One day she had still been the Elsa that Saul knew, the one who smiled and laughed and had no worries, the one Saul loved because she was beautiful and noble and perfect; but then the next she was Queen Elsa, untouchable and removed. It stung that there were barriers between them now, but Saul convinced himself that it was fine, that he would continue to stand by her side until she acknowledged him again.

But she never did. Saul never expected thanks, but a small part of him had hoped Elsa would notice his efforts.

And when Hans tore at the wounds that had never closed…

"I hate to admit it, but Hans has a point," Reid said, hawkish features of his thin face accentuated by absolute disgust behind slightly tapered eyes. But at the same time, he reluctantly nodded his head. "No matter what frivolous garbage he usually spouts, this time I do agree."

"I come to you not because I seek more troubles," Saul answered, clasping his face with a single hand to hide his eyes. Maybe visiting Oliver and Reid hadn't been the best idea. He had confided in them, and they took it as permission to bring up the old subject. "If I had desired it, I would have gone to Fabian."

"You know the two of us will stand by your decision, but…I have never doubted that you should be king," Oliver said hesitantly, taciturn as always. Standing, he crossed the room – though his stockier build meant it took several strides – to the sofa where Saul sat and placed a hand over his shoulder. "I mean no offense against Elsa, but Father chose wrong."

"I don't understand why you're so hung up with her!" Reid exclaimed. "It's very _romantic,_ I suppose, the whole sorceress and knight trope, but really–"

"Reid, watch yourself," Oliver interrupted.

Reid only rolled his eyes and scowled. "Oh, go to hell. You and I both know that Saul needs to get over this! Look, Tobias has done something, and even if he was stupid and got himself killed, at least he had the right idea–"

"What you're proposing is nothing short of treason," Oliver said. "Even if Saul became king, he would sit on an unsteady throne and rule with a tainted name."

Reid waved Oliver aside and leaned in towards Saul. "At least do something about _Anna_ then, if you're so damn obsessed with Elsa," Reid said. "Saul, just give me the word and I will pick up a sword, run over there, and gut her just like _that_–"

"Enough," Saul said quietly. Though his voice was barely more than a whisper, his ire carried so strongly the whisper may as well have been a shout. Reid promptly backed off at the rare show of displeasure.

Saul still had his eyes hidden behind his hand, so when the silence stretched on, he saw nothing and only tried to sort out his chaotic thoughts. On one hand was his ambition, but on the other was Elsa. Saul refused to act against her. What gnawed at his mind was not subordination, because he would gladly have Elsa as his queen. If only…

Why were the others so silent? Saul looked up, and then instantly jerked away from the surreal sight that welcomed him. Both Oliver and Reid were stock-still and petrified in mid-motion, Oliver still with his mouth open as though to speak and Reid partially off of his chair.

"I wondered when you would notice."

It was a deep rumble of a voice that had spoken, seemingly coming from everywhere and nowhere at once, a ghastly effect as though the sound traveled unseen from ear to ear. Saul sprang to his feet, but even as he whirled around looking for the source of the voice, he saw no one else.

"You can stop looking."

Saul caught a hint of movement, but he told himself that his eyes had to have deceived him. Shadows couldn't _move_. But whatever logical sense he subscribed to, the rationality he possessed was shattered when Oliver's shadow stretched forward and melded with that of Reid. Even the shadows of the chairs coalesced into one dark mass before it snaked upwards into the form of a man swathed in darkness.

Part of him wanted to flee, the age-old preservation instinct embedded in every human being screaming that this was beyond him. Another part told him it was pointless. But when Saul tried anyway, he found his legs bound by the same inky shadows, thick bands feeling like slime and fire. Slowly they forced him down to his seat. With no other choice, Saul took a closer glance at the man. The shadows created some sort of hooded cloak that waxed and waned, so that his form was unrecognizable. The only static feature was a steel mask. Saul tried to look at his eyes, but there were no slits. Instead, the mask, drawn inwards below the eyes to resemble the skull of a beast, bore two thick streaks of red painted into a cross.

No, not a cross but a _crucifix._ It was indistinct but bits of paint were missing, forming the outline of a human being.

"Should I introduce myself?"

"I think that is unnecessary," Saul said slowly. "You're the Sorcerer that Elsa spoke of. You're the one who killed Alvard and Tobias."

"As expected from Saul. But _Elsa_ killed Alvard," the Sorcerer replied. The shadows moved closer until he loomed only a foot away. "And Tobias brought it upon himself. Justice was served, I acted for Elsa."

"And as for me?"

"There's nothing to fear. I only want to talk."

"What courtesy is it to bind the one you wish to speak to?"

Mask tilting curiously, the shadows stabilized into a physical form and the figure stepped out. Average height. Average build. Average everything. Saul doubted this was really how the Sorcerer looked at all.

"I will release you then," the Sorcerer said. With a flick of his newly formed hand, the bands stretched across Saul's body drew back like whips.

The instant he was free, Saul launched himself forward.

And found himself passing through the Sorcerer, as though he were insubstantial smoke. A hand clamped down on his wrist before he could fall, wiry strength enough to make his bones creak in protest; Saul was first pulled back and then thrown aside as easily as a ragdoll, hitting the wall so powerfully he thought his spine might snap. Saul barely had time to blink before he found the Sorcerer close, hand curled around his throat to crush him against the wall. Heat radiated from him. He smelled of musk and some dark spice that tickled at the back of his throat, and Saul felt his breath hitch involuntarily.

"And what courtesy is it to attack me?" asked the Sorcerer. His fingers caressed Saul's jaw line and his neck, dragging over his throat, before he deigned to step back. Saul collapsed to the floor choking for air. "It is so very sad you are content to be a pawn, ignored and forgotten, when you should be a knight."

"Wh-What are you saying?" Saul gasped.

The Sorcerer turned and spread his arms wide. "Your wings, Saul, your glorious wings. Did you even know you had them? They are chained down by your hesitance, your altruism, and you will never fly until you shake them off. What is this self-sacrifice for self-sacrifice's sake? Really. Such a romantic ideal you cling to. Reid was not wrong."

"You wouldn't understand–"

"Maybe not. I have no heart; I carved it out. But then again…" Without warning the Sorcerer whirled around and slammed his hand down on Saul's head. The shadows bled off his fingers, enshrouding Saul's face and streaming into his eyes, his ears, his nose. With another push, the Sorcerer muffled his scream against the floor. "So did Elsa."

With the shadows came images, streaming through his mind so quickly that bile rose to his throat from dizzying disorientation. He nearly vomited, but Saul could pick out bits and pieces of what was being conveyed to him. A reliquary, a heart carven out and locked away in unthawing ice…? But what truly hurt had yet to come. Next were images of two figures standing at a balcony under a moonlit sky.

"Elsa," Saul gasped, seeing her embrace Anna. His heart thudded painfully against his ribs. Elsa's name didn't slow it. It didn't calm him as it once had.

"Now you see." Seemingly satisfied, the Sorcerer pulled back once more. "You have been replaced."

"Why are you showing me this?" Saul murmured.

"I offer you everything that you desire," the Sorcerer said, his finger flicking against Saul's chin, tilting his head up. "You can have the throne, and even Elsa."

Saul laughed bitterly and tore away, fueled once more by indignation. "Who do you think you are? What makes you think you can guarantee me those things? I will never have Elsa."

"You are drawn to me because you desire what I have to give you. You want power. You crave it. You will always crave it." Once again, the mask cocked to one side, then the other, like a marionette on strings. "You are a pawn now, but through me you will become more."

A shudder ran down Saul's spine, the oil-slicked fingers of temptation sliding painfully under his skin. Slowly, he rose to his feet, cradling his arm where the Sorcerer had touched him. It burned even now but he could feel the Sorcerer moving in his _mind_, the phantom touch more than physical, as though he had diffused himself into his blood.

"Why do you need me?" Saul asked.

"Does it matter? It shouldn't matter to you when you need me more than I need you. What _is_ important is what I can offer you."

"I haven't agreed," Saul said, easing his way back onto his feet, feeling his shaking legs threaten to collapse under him though he braced himself against the wall. "First Alvard and then Tobias, and you still think I'll just trust you? You won't get away with this."

Saul could hear the smile in the Sorcerer's voice as he melted into the shadows and vanished; Oliver and Reid came to life, completely unaware of what had just transpired. The Sorcerer disappeared, but not before leaving one last message echoing, echoing, echoing in his head.

_Oh, I already have._

"Everything's going to be different now," Elsa murmured.

Anna pressed a kiss to her bare shoulder, grinning softly that she could actually _do_ that now. It was still a shock that she was holding Elsa, hugging her from behind as they lay there just basking in the other's presence. She would probably never get over that feeling of awe. "It's a good different," Anna said.

"Maybe," Elsa said unconvincingly. Anna was just about to launch into a long speech about being positive and, goddammit, she was ruining the moment, when Elsa added dryly, "I shudder to think of Alek's reaction now that I really have subjected you to my, and I quote, _perverse whims_."

"Wait, you _know_ about that?" Anna buried her head into Elsa's loosened hair, blushing when she felt the vibrations of Elsa laughing softly. "We didn't even actually do anything like _that_–"

"Of course not. And, in fact, you were the one to seduce me," Elsa said. "Did you know Alek came around to threaten me again, only this time for your sake?"

"I preferred when you weren't being sarcastic," Anna groaned, and Elsa laughed just a little harder. Speaking of Alek though, since he left last time Anna had seen him only a scant few times and exchanged even fewer words with him. "Is he feeling better now?"

"We have come to an agreement for now. His attempts on my life are on hold until he finds the Sorcerer," Elsa said. Anna stiffened uncomfortably, and Elsa must have felt it because she turned and gave her a smile. "He is proud, but a good person underneath all that. You chose a good friend to make."

"I always choose well." Anna grinned and kissed Elsa again, not exactly one of her heat-of-the-moment kisses but certainly not chaste, something close to the former and that could very well lead into more.

Anna heard Elsa release a tiny gasp when she bit on her lip, and that noise empowered her more than anything ever could. Only an hour or two had passed but Anna was bolder now, and without hesitation she swept her tongue across Elsa's lip and then into her mouth, muffling another groan as she explored for the umpteenth time. Elsa wrapped her arms around her shoulders when Anna swung herself on top.

Being so close to Elsa was always a thrill, feeling the reserved queen let down her barriers only for her, feeling the contained force of nature so dangerously close but knowing she would never hurt her. When Anna pulled away for air, she noticed Elsa playing with her strand of bleached hair, twirling it between her fingers.

"You really like doing that," Anna said.

"I'm glad you haven't cut it, I – I like seeing it," Elsa admitted, looking everywhere but at her eyes, and Anna grinned again. It was more accurate to say that she just couldn't _stop_ grinning. Elsa was adorable.

"I like it too," Anna said.

"I just wish it wasn't there because I hurt you."

"That had nothing to do with you. It was my fault and we both know it." Anna brushed that stubborn lone bang out of Elsa's face and tucked it behind her ear, giving her a clearer view of her eyes. "If you blame yourself again, I'll be forced to do something _terrible_ to you."

Elsa didn't look very convinced. Anna decided that a show of her power would be necessary, and so she quickly leaned down, pulled Elsa's shirt higher – ignoring her strangled cry of surprise – pressed her lips against her stomach, and blew.

No reaction. Anna stared questioningly until Elsa sat up and shrugged.

"I'm not ticklish."

"That's not even fair." Anna pouted. She had spent a good ten minutes laughing at first when Elsa so much as touched her bare waist. "What else are you hiding from me?"

"I don't actually need to blink," Elsa said, remarkably seriously. Anna searched her face with narrowed eyes. Elsa had one mean poker face, but she had enough practice by now to tell…

"I can see you hiding a smile," Anna grumbled, shaking her head when Elsa cracked and smiled. "You're just lucky that you're a good kisser."

"Is the appropriate response to thank you?"

Elsa and her sudden dry wit would be the death of her, Anna thought, trying hard to be exasperated but too happy about her opening up to really feel offended at all. Speaking of being a good kisser though, Elsa was almost suspiciously good.

"So you used to be close to Saul, right?" Anna asked, trying her hardest to make it sound casual.

"Yes," Elsa answered. She quirked an eyebrow. "You're not thinking we ever had anything more?"

"Never even crossed my mind," Anna said, hopping off the bed with her back towards Elsa so she could hide the mixed disgruntlement and relief on her face. Not that there would be anything wrongwith it if they had, but she was happy to hear it anyway. It was just irritating that Elsa could tell.

Which might have been why Elsa bothered to continue explaining, sounding faintly nostalgic. "We were close, but even though I still care for him, there was nothing else."

"You two really don't seem close anymore. I actually thought you were upset with him that one time." Anna walked to the wardrobe and rummaged through for something suitable to wear.

"We didn't part on the best of terms. It was my fault," Elsa said.

"Are you sure?" Anna turned, and this time it was her turn to raise an eyebrow. "I mean, I talked to him before and I'm pretty sure he loves you."

"I know," Elsa murmured. "But I broke off our friendship, and I am to blame for it. I always knew how he felt, but I was too broken and he never realized just how much. There were too many barriers between us. Both of us are too adept at hiding our thoughts, too learned in being royal."

Anna said nothing. She had the feeling Elsa was talking to herself just as much as she was talking to her, so she stayed silent and let Elsa continue uninterrupted.

"And then when I became queen, I alienated many people. Even that small shred of me that could accept others was gone, and I pushed them all away." Elsa creating her reliquary went unsaid. Anna wondered if part of the reason had been so she wouldn't give Saul false hope anymore. "I thought it was better for them, and for me, that I be alone."

"No one wants to be alone," Anna said. Elsa only smiled sadly in response, and nodded. Anna went back to searching the wardrobe. "But you said _them_? Were you close to the others too?"

"Edmund," Elsa said, small smile at the edge of her lips growing into something more genuine.

Anna nearly fell into the wardrobe at that admission. Elsa had been close to _Edmund_? They just seemed so different, practically like night and day. But once she got over the shock, she realized she should have seen it sooner. Edmund was doubtlessly more accepting than the others, and put into context, his encouragement of her trying to understand Elsa made so much sense.

"No wonder he always told me good things about you," Anna said.

"Did he?" Elsa blinked.

"Part of me changing my opinion about you might have been because he told me to give you a chance," Anna admitted. She winced when Elsa tilted her head. "Okay, that sounded bad. I mean, I was really, _really_ upset with you for a while, but _now_ I'm not, and–"

"I'm only surprised Edmund would say that," Elsa interrupted. "I remember he was very vocal against me taking the throne." Anna frowned, but Elsa added, "It was because I wanted to exile Gustaf."

Speaking of making things sound bad, Anna thought, Elsa had just as much talent as she did. She just looked at her questioningly and waited.

"Markus has held Gustaf's wife and child on an adjoining island ever since his rebellion," Elsa explained. "I would have sent him there too, but Edmund was against it."

"That doesn't sound so bad," Anna said. "I wonder why he was against it…"

"They are very close. Maybe Edmund wanted his brother to stay," Elsa said. "Regardless of the reason, our relationship soured after that. I…regret it."

Edmund seemed fine now, judging by their conversations, but Anna kept silent. Elsa looked deep in thought, so Anna simply turned back to the wardrobe and resumed her abandoned task of picking something to wear. She had been standing there for a good five minutes with nothing to show for it.

Just as she thought that, Anna felt from behind her the tell-tale burst of cold air of Elsa recreating her ice dress, and she turned out of curiosity. It looked perfect, not a single stitch out of place. Elsa seemed to have taken some liberties though. Instead of a cape attached to her dress, a cloak hung off a snowflake brooch clasped at the base of her throat.

"Hey, that turned out well," Anna said.

Elsa stared down at her hands with wide eyes. "I didn't mean to make something new. It just happened, I was thinking about wanting change, and…" Elsa swallowed. "It happened."

Did that mean she was regaining more control? Struck by sudden inspiration, Anna grabbed a random dress from the wardrobe, changed into it as quickly as she could manage while Elsa remained stunned, and then waved a hand in front of Elsa's eyes. When Elsa looked at her questioningly, Anna said, "Try to make me one."

"It's too dangerous!" Elsa backed away and shook her head, clutching her hands close.

"I trust you," Anna said. "Besides, I'm wearing a dress that you can work off of. I'll be fine."

"My ice can cut through _castles_. A dress–" Elsa looked away. "It's a bad idea and you know it."

"Maybe, but I have faith in you. I want to help you," Anna said softly. She reached out and gently cradled Elsa's head so that their eyes met. "You can learn control again, I know you can."

"I could hurt you," Elsa whispered.

"But you never have," Anna said. "Even when you lost control, your magic always stopped short." Elsa froze anyone who touched her bare skin, but Anna alone was immune. In the office, the spikes had halted before they could touch Anna. Even when the reliquary had struck her, Anna survived. "Maybe you've always had control. You don't want to hurt me, so your magic stops before it does."

Elsa swallowed. Her mind was racing, Anna could tell, but Elsa still answered weakly, "That might be true, but we don't know for sure. It's not worth it."

"I won't push you. I'll let you choose," Anna said. She backed off and waited. "I just want you to know that I'm willing to try if you are."

Elsa took a deep breath before finally reaching forward. Anna felt her heartbeat quicken until her breath hitched, and she wondered if it was her or Elsa. Maybe both. Centimeters away, Elsa stopped and closed her hand, eyes boring into hers. "Are you sure about this?"

"Perfectly sure."

Elsa opened her hand and ice flowed from her fingertips, painfully slow, as though it had to first push through a film of oil. Maybe it was for greater control, but while she created her own dress with a simple wave of her hand, Elsa instead physically touched Anna. Anna shivered at the feeling of her fingers dragging up her arm and then up her shoulder, across her collarbone and back down her front. Her eyes closed involuntarily at the pleasing cold replacing fabric and whispering over her skin. Elsa passed her sternum and then down to her navel before making one last, broad sweep.

Anna gazed down. Her ordinary wool and velvet dress was gone, replaced by ice that reflected the light at a hundred angles, shimmering with each movement she made. Her arms were left bare save for off-the-shoulder sleeves, as were her shoulders. Though the form-fitting bodice and skirt were ice she noticed the cold only as an afterthought, not something that would bother her. It was at once more elegant and yet more fitting than anything she had ever owned. This was made for her, by _Elsa._

"It's beautiful," Anna gasped. She spun on her heel and watched the ends twirl around her legs. When she heard a sharp intake of breath, Anna looked back to Elsa and was startled to see tears in her eyes. "Elsa! Are you okay?"

"It's been so long," Elsa said shakily, but she was smiling even as she sobbed. Without hesitation, she pulled Anna into a tight hug. "I did it! I can't believe – I really did it!"

Anna smiled into Elsa's shoulder and hugged her tighter.

"I always knew you could."

**a/n:** Want to take a gander at who the Sorcerer is? It's not obvious at all. Now you have to wonder if I'm really being sarcastic or not!
