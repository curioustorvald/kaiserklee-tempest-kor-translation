**Chapter 31: The Prodigal Son**

Anna knocked once, thrice, and then once more.

As usual, Edmund called for her to come in, and Anna slid open a newly repaired door to step into the bedroom of the twelfth prince. Edmund was still bedridden, with his eye bandaged so that a good quarter of his face was hidden behind gauze. Half of his hair was flattened under the bandaging while the other half stuck out like a porcupine. Upon seeing Anna his lips turned into a smile and he waved. It was a small smile and a small gesture, incomparable to his old cheer, but Anna was glad to see them anyway. She returned his smile, crossed over to his side, and took a seat.

"Hey, you're looking lots better today," Anna said.

Edmund chortled. "Are you saying that because my face is hidden?"

"Yeah! Definitely an improvement."

"Mean," Edmund grumbled. "Well, I'm actually conscious this time so anything you want to talk about besides the integrity of my face?"

Her visits had begun immediately after the Sorcerer incident, once Saul deemed Edmund strong enough for visitors. Anna had never asked about the extent of Edmund's involvement, and an unspoken agreement had formed between her and Elsa that they were not to interrogate him. Elsa wanted to, Anna was sure of it, and some part of her knew that the answers were necessary; but Edmund had barely been conscious the first time she visited, and hardly better the second. It was only now that his face regained some color.

She spent much of her first visit observing Edmund's room while he rested, and only then did Anna realize she had never been inside. It was neater than she expected. Judging from the flippant way Edmund behaved, she imagined his room to be an absolute mess, but reality was the exact opposite. Edmund kept his room pristine, so much so that it couldn't have been attributed to maids and servants alone. It had to take conscious effort for the triple bookcase with ladder and rail to be perfectly sorted, and Anna noticed the mind-boggling plethora of languages it contained: English, Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, German, Romanian, Russian, Latin, even Chinese, and several others Anna couldn't name. Strangest of all was that none of the books were to _teach_ the languages, but was actual literature.

"Are you actually fluent in all those?" Anna asked.

"Thirteen languages," Edmund answered. At her awestruck expression, he laughed and tapped the side of his head. "It's not hard. I have a good memory and an even better focus when I put my mind to it."

"Oh, that's right," Anna said. "You have eidetic memory."

"True, but I don't think I ever told you that," Edmund said, smiling much too smugly with his head cocked to one side. "After all, I would remember."

"It was…" Anna shrugged without elaboration. Best not to mention the reliquary. "Never mind. You know, Elsa has eidetic memory too."

"I wouldn't be surprised." Gesturing to the rest of his room, Edmund added, "Did anything else catch your eye, beside the fascinating bookcase?"

Truth be told, everything in his room was faintly fascinating. It was like an amalgamation of the personalities of all the princes contained in this one room, cluttered by sheer volume but orderly in placement. On one side of the room were three paintings, all of them Biblical, with the centerpiece an over-large depiction of Archangel Michael and the Dragon. Stefan. Placed in front of them was a grand piano with the sheet music for Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Rafael. On a rack adjacent to the bed lay a longsword and a shorter parrying dagger. Alek and Alvard. Even Saul was represented by a tea set in one corner of the room, and Anna knew Edmund had a working knowledge of wine to account for Reid.

"None of that _really_ interests me," Edmund said, shrugging nonchalantly when Anna gave him a questioning glance. "It's just easier, you know, to be inspired by the others. So I copied what they did, what they liked. I thought that this way, maybe I could find what was really…me."

But aside from the others, most prominent of all was Gustaf. While everything else was placed with impersonally perfect organization, sitting crookedly on the windowsill was a chessboard with moved pieces. There was no table set or any other surface meant for the board, or even proper seats. Anna could imagine Gustaf and Edmund sitting casually on the sill while they played.

"…What about that?" Anna asked.

Edmund looked towards the window as though startled, and for a moment Anna thought he might not answer. At least, until his lips formed a small smile. "It was…fun. I actually liked playing chess. I was never very good, you know, but I had fun. And he would always tell me I was _too_ focused, I needed to set myself free. But…that's just not how my mind works. Everything he tried to teach me, I just – I could never understand. Not just chess. I can't understand what he did."

"You two really were close," Anna murmured.

Anna had doubted that when she thought about what Gustaf did in the chapel. But then none of it seemed to match the way she had seen them interact, the words Gustaf gave Edmund at the end. And, especially, the look in Edmund's eyes now. It was the same as Gustaf at the chapel. Maybe Anna still didn't understand, but there _was_ a bond there.

"…We were. Weren't we?" Edmund stilled and placed his hands in his lap, but they still shook and he never stopped staring downwards, curling the fingers of his right hand inwards and then out again. "Yeah, we really were."

Anna didn't say anything. Edmund wasn't speaking to her, not anymore.

"…Sometimes I thought otherwise. I chafed at his direction, I resented him. But at the end, I realized how much he cared." Edmund released a deep groan, guttural and almost animalistic at the end, when his frustration spilled over and he burrowed his head in his hands. Though he looked pained, Anna knew it wasn't any injury that bothered him. "I just don't understand. What he did doesn't make any sense. I never thought that Gustaf…!"

"Everything will be fine now," Anna murmured. "If you want to talk–"

Edmund's head snapped up, his previously troubled eyes clearing with sudden, vivid clarity. "You didn't come here to talk about my room. Did you, Anna?"

"S-Sorry, I didn't mean to pry–"

"No, I understand." Edmund took a deep breath, and just like that, his composure returned in the blink of an eye. In all honesty, the sudden change was startling rather than comforting. If she hadn't just witnessed his honest frustration, Anna would have been fooled by his seemingly genuine smile. His lips were tilted just the right way, slightly lopsided, and even his eyes curved into crinkled half-moons. It was _too_ real. Edmund might have noticed her hesitation, because he asked, "Is something wrong?"

"Nothing," Anna said quickly. "I-I'm sorry, I don't know what to say all of a sudden."

"Gotcha. Guess I'll just start talking, but I'm sure you've guessed. I always knew what Gustaf was…doing." Edmund kept his face straight when he spoke, without pause and without break. It was a methodical, mechanicalthing. "Or I thought I did, but I didn't really realize the extent until you told me about the Sorcerer. After that, I went to tell him, and that was when Alek saw me vanish. Gustaf pulled me through. And then later, he told me to wait in the chapel while he went to the reliquary. All this time, I was trying to convince Gustaf not to hurt anyone, but…I'm sorry, Anna."

It took ten seconds of silence for Anna to realize that Edmund was done. She thought he might say more, but she decided against pushing. It was over, and she knew what she needed to anyway.

"You tried," Anna said.

"…Yeah. I really did."

There was so much more she could have said. She should have chastised him for not speaking up, could have offered him some sort of comfort, but any other words Anna might have said were strangled in her throat. She ended up silently sitting with the prince for a time, during which he would repeatedly clench and unclench his hand.

Suddenly Edmund broke the silence. "Will you go with me to somewhere?"

Anna hurriedly stood when Edmund pushed off the bed and swung his legs over the side. "Wait! Are you sure you should be going anywhere?"

"I'll be fine." Edmund took a few steps toward the door, then spun on his heel and stretched out his arms. "See? Perfect."

"Where do you even…?" Anna drew in a sharp intake of breath when she realized. "You want to go to Gustaf's room. So you need me." Elsa had sealed the room since his death, but of course, Anna could get through without incident. But she knew Elsa wouldn't want anyone intruding. "But, Edmund–"

"Please, I need this," Edmund said somberly, dropping his arms and looking Anna dead in the eyes. "I never thought I would say this, but I've never needed anything more. Please, Anna."

She couldn't refuse.

* * *

Everything had moved so quickly afterwards.

Elsa knew she ought to report to Markus. She had already failed to keep his cryonic sleep undisturbed, allowing the Sorcerer to infiltrate the tower not just once but twice, and herself nearly destroying the entire chamber with her redirected attack from the Mirror. During the battle, she had focused on protecting Anna rather than Markus and left him vulnerable. She could argue that his defenses were already too powerful to be destroyed, but she knew that she had prioritized Anna. Elsa doubted that Markus would be pleased with her decisions. It would be best to make her report now.

But she was exhausted.

Less than a week had passed since the battle and ensuing search, and Elsa was already weary beyond measure. She had revealed the plotting of the Sorcerer to the rest of the princes, linked him to the deaths of Alvard, Tobias, and Reid, and finally unveiled his identity with news of Gustaf. A much-reduced court of the remaining nine princes – Edmund, still bedridden from the ordeal – stood at attention. They had reacted as Elsa suspected they would.

It was utter pandemonium.

Fabian, always a staunch supporter of Gustaf, claimed that she fabricated the whole thing to be rid of the eldest prince who was mandated to rule; Rafael, always a voice of dissent against his brothers, replied with caustic remarks delivered in his trademark infuriating calm. Between the two of them and the mingled voices of the rest, Cyrus adding to the chaos and Alek hardly helping with his lack of tact, Elsa was left with a growing headache. Once, she would have silenced them all with magic. Now, for whatever reason, she just didn't care enough to even bother.

Thankfully Saul had interjected with much needed reason, and Fabian quieted. Perhaps it was merit of his complete blood-relation with Gustaf, but Saul seemed to have filled in the vacuum left in his wake; Cyrus and Fabian now looked to him for direction. Hans had actually helped as well, calming Alek, and Saul gave Elsa a discrete nod before patching over the dicey situation with incredible adroitness.

Later in private, Elsa told him, "Sometimes I wonder why Markus did not bestow to you the right to rule. You keep them in line better than I ever could."

"Only because I care to do so. If you were so inclined, you could do the same," Saul said.

They were in her office, Saul brewing herbal tea to alleviate her headaches as she perused documents in preparation of the burial for Gustaf. She had no idea why she was doing this. Perhaps Edmund had infected her with his sentimentality. Perhaps some small part of her had sympathized for the Sorcerer's plight. Or, perhaps, she had respected _Gustaf_ more than she realized. Truthfully, Elsa still could not reconcile the two as the same person. She didn't think of this as a burial for the Sorcerer. Only Gustaf.

"Do you begrudge me at all for killing your brother?" Elsa asked.

Saul paused for a moment before resuming his brewing, pouring boiling water into a clay kettle sitting over a bed of coals, allowing it to steep the leaves. "You should know already."

"Since his death has given you a more favorable position in the court…" Elsa laughed mirthlessly when Saul turned to her with protest on his tongue. "I apologize."

"It's true enough," Saul admitted. "My influence over the others has strengthened, and even Rafael will heed my words. At least I can help you keep them in line."

"Thank you." Elsa accepted the offer of tea and sipped on the caustic, bitter drink without hesitation. Its horrid taste was soothing, somehow realer than the sweetness of chocolate. It lingered.

"Alek may yet be a problem." Saul sighed when Elsa raised an eyebrow. "I admire his skill and especially his courage, but at the same time, Alek has a certain disrespect for authority. You cannot have forgotten already. It was not so long ago that he challenged your rule."

"Alek is loyal to Anna, and that is more than enough," Elsa said.

Anna did have a strange ability to bring out another side to the people she met. Alek was not the first, or even the most dramatic; Elsa had known that beneath his dislike for her had been someone determined to do good. It was nothing short of a miracle, however, that _Hans_ was now helping with the supply caravans. Once too absorbed in his vengeance to think of anyone else, Hans had now even volunteered to join the excursions into castle town and survey what more needed to be done for the people. Considering the changes in _herself_, Elsa had no doubts about Anna's influence.

Saul frowned. "But you are certain that her priorities lie with you?"

"Where else would they be?"

"Forgive me for being blunt, but…" Saul cleared his throat when Elsa motioned for him to continue. "I have noticed some friction between you lately. Might her priorities have shifted?"

"I have never doubted Anna," Elsa said, placing her tea aside to regard Saul with her full attention. "We will be as we were soon enough."

"At the end of the day, Anna is not one of us. She belongs with Arendelle," Saul stressed, and whether due to exhaustion weakening her defenses or her own fears growing too great to suppress, Elsa recoiled at the mention of her old home. As if sensing her apprehension, Saul added, "She is not yours."

"Enough." Elsa rose from her seat and strode to the windows, looking out to the white plains of snow that were her haven. It was not Arendelle and not, even, the Southern Isles. It belonged only to her.

Not like Anna. Elsa had never meant to or even wanted to possess her, but the distance had grown and she knew, deep down, that Anna wasn't happy here. They were so far apart now. Elsa spent most of her time ensconced in her office, and Anna was occupied with either Edmund or Hans and Alek. Elsa treasured every moment of their brief time together, whether at meals or at night, but their promised talk had not yet occurred. It hung over them, an unspoken guillotine not unnoticed, because Elsa didn't have the courage to admit aloud something she had always known.

Neither of them was happy.

Elsa waved Saul away without looking back, content, for now, to gaze alone upon the wide plains of snow and forget her troubles in its pure, untainted expanse.

* * *

It was a short walk.

Anna pressed her hand against the wall of ice sealing Gustaf's bedroom, and as had happened so many times before, the barrier shattered like fragile glass. At this point she really ought to be used to it, but the sight still surprised her just as much as the first time. It was practically proof of Elsa's acceptance, and despite everything now standing between them, the sight relieved her just a bit.

"All right, here we…are."

She quieted when Edmund pushed past her to stand directly at the doorway. His hand outstretched to clutch the side of the arch as his eyes roved the room, and he stood motionless, unbreathing, so completely still that he could have been a mannequin. Finally, his eyes turned towards the ground, to the shattered remnants of the black-wood door that Elsa had destroyed. Taking a deep breath, he stepped past the splintered fragments and entered the room.

Anna followed.

Last time she had been here, she had only the briefest glimpse. Compared to the lavish door, everything inside was simple, practically austere. In fact, there was nothing of luxury save for the black-and-white flooring. Contrary to the needlessly enormous beds of the other princes, Gustaf had the thin, uncomfortable mattress of a peasant. A chest lay at the foot of the bed, but it was plain, wooden. On an equally plain table were scattered sheets of rice paper for calligraphy, though, strangely, adorned with the occasional paperfolded crane.

But there was one striking thing about the room. Anna had noticed last time, but only now, standing closer, could she really admire the portrait hanging on the far wall, placed over a small altar along with more of the paper cranes, and even a bouquet of paper flowers. She walked closer, awestruck by the beautiful woman depicted. Something about her was familiar. She possessed a distinctly graceful, feminine air, gentle, and she wore the plain clothing that a commoner might. Her features were soft, framed by long white-blonde hair, and her eyes were kind, curved into half-moons when she smiled.

"Celina," Edmund explained, stepping towards the altar and then kneeling. Anna watched, confused, as he touched his forehead to the floor before rising. "She was Gustaf's wife."

"Oh." It made sense. Anna had been thrown by how young the woman looked, but now she remembered that Celina had been exiled twenty years ago.

"Gustaf made me bow every time I came inside," Edmund said, but he was smiling and looked not the slightest bit irritated by the practice. "Well, I don't mind. I'm not sure why, but I like seeing her."

"You know…" Anna looked to the portrait and back to Edmund, and it clicked in her mind why the woman had looked familiar. "She reminds me of you."

"Really?" Edmund laughed.

"Actually, yeah, really." Other than the different hair color, Edmund shared many of the same features: pale skin, slender nose, a heart-shaped face with a slightly wide forehead and pointed chin, but most prominent of all was their eyes. Celina's were grey-blue and Edmund's black, but they were the exact same shape, close-set, hooded and almond-shaped. They even curved the same way when they smiled.

It was uncanny.

But Edmund had walked away and didn't answer, instead rummaging through the chest after having somehow opened the lock while Anna was engrossed with the portrait of Celina. Edmund pulled out sheets of used calligraphy paper and set them aside, peering down into the chest with eyebrows furrowed, and Anna joined him to see a large envelope marked with his name. Slowly, Edmund withdrew the envelope. Anna watched, perplexed, as he only stared at it.

"Aren't you going to open that?" Anna asked.

"I should, but I'm not sure I want to." Edmund flipped the envelope over in his hands so that the wax seal was visible. "Do you think I ought to?"

"It's yours," Anna said. "You can just throw it away if you want, or you can read it. It's up to you. But…I'll be here if you want me to be."

Edmund nodded and, without hesitation, broke the seal open.

Several sheets of paper fell out.

_Edmund,_

_If I know you as well as I hope, then you will come here for answers following my death. You will not have understood. You will, having raged at the unknown, come here believing I can provide what you seek. But I confess that beyond that, I have no predictions or even hopes for you. Of what you find here, I cannot know what you will take away. And, truth be told, that terrifies me. I have never placed much stock in hope. It has failed me time and time again._

_I wonder if you will bow to Ina once you arrive here. I hope I have engrained that custom into your mind, if not your heart and soul. You have gazed upon her face but you have never seen, and that is why I worry. But perhaps I place too little faith in you now, just as, once, I placed too much. Regardless, I owe you answers. It is my duty to you, and one I have neglected. Perhaps that is why…_

_But I digress._

_Let me tell you about a man named Gustaf, and how his life began and ended._

_Once, he was Crown Prince of the Southern Isles. Justice was his creed and power his birthright. Born with the gift of shadow, his retribution was strong enough to cleanse the world of the impurities he despised. But his heart was cold. His life was one of isolation, of privation, and his world black and white. Gustaf was proud, and arrogant, and so self-righteous that he believed his cruel justice to be salvation rather than the reckless judgment it was. Gustaf was blind. His power was as dust on the wind, and his beliefs no less feeble._

_And he did not understand himself._

_Oftentimes we delude ourselves with notions of good and evil, but if morality were so simple as to be divided into black and white, there would be no more evil. In that case, evil could be identified and dragged under the light for all the world to detest. Certainly, that world would be ideal, but there is no such division. It is a universal human condition to crave the illusion of absolutes, that we might follow one higher truth and be led to salvation. In our haste for absolution we forget ourselves and abandon our identity. It was this trap into which Gustaf stumbled, and those who wield power will stop at nothing to drag others into the same purgatory._

_Certainly he believed he was doing good. Society required order that must be enforced, and it was his mandate to be the enforcer. But Gustaf forgot one truth that makes us human. We can be selfish, and there is nothing so wrong with that. In fact, I encourage selfishness. All that we are capable of is to look into our hearts, understand our own will, and that is the singular greatest good that might be done._

_For I believe that we desire happiness above all else, and one woman taught me that happiness need not be built upon the subjugation of others. It was then that I ceased to be Crown Prince Gustaf._

_When I first met her, I was chasing fugitives._

_I was young, then, fourteen at the most, and I had not yet constructed Baaj. I was not yet so dogged in my justice, or as cruel. Already arrogant, of course, and out of mistaken belief of my invincibility, I pursued the so-called traitors alone and was injured. Stranded, wounded, believing my time on this earth was at an end, I was rescued by a girl with blue eyes. I did not ask her name. We spent nary a day together, and I fled. I collapsed again. She found me once more._

_"I'll keep finding you, so wait until you can stand on your own, all right?"_

_Not often did I take orders…but something made me heed her words._

_So I spent my days there, resting, learning, watching as she crafted cranes out of paper. I decried the practice as trivial, but she replied that only by indulging in triviality might we have the time for wisdom. She said it might calm the rage in my heart. So I rested, and I watched the trivial lives of trivial people, and I saw but did not understand why they appeared so happy while I could find no peace. She told me that the heart is the most powerful force in the world, that it could bring me happiness if I allowed it. By the time I left, I still did not understand. I still did not ask her name._

_And I returned here, greeted by exaltation, and I think I did begin to understand. It frightened me so that I hardened my heart and became the tyrant prince._

_I created Baaj. I imprisoned so many there, regardless of innocence. It was my greatest creation, a prison for the reformation of God's children, but also a labyrinth of torture that shall haunt me to the end of my days. It was the place where I discovered my father's madness. Father had placed all his hopes on me, and I had loved and admired him; but I could not stomach what he turned my prison into. Somewhere beneath my delusion, I believed I was protecting the people. When I saw his foray into the darkest of magics, the rejection of humanity, I woke. None of this could be right._

_I do not know when Father discovered it, but the Mirror is a strange thing. It has no name, no intent. But it holds such a promise of power that even a shard had ensnared Father completely. I sometimes place blame on an insentient artifact, until I realize Father's madness stems from his own greed, his own fear. Father does not wish to die. Father would subjugate everything, rule until the end of the earth and beyond if he could. Father so wished to control the Mirror that he tried everything._

_Only years later do I realize the irony that Father must have understood the same thing the blue-eyed girl told me. It was the heart that could move the Mirror. It was the heart that would move me._

_In my despair, I unknowingly returned to that place and found her again. Only a few years had passed, but her wisdom had grown and I had diminished. She welcomed me once more. She offered me a crane. I took it. As time passed, my rage did calm. I began to see the truth, that there is no higher truth other than my own heart. All this time I had only been numbing myself, pretending there was ever anything more to my cruelty than myself. I wanted to fill an emptiness within me I had never recognized._

_I returned home again, changed, but I was still favored and my requests granted. Baaj was destroyed. I began to change, I was kinder, I would do good unto others rather than quell their supposed evil, and I would routinely go to Celina. It did not go unnoticed. Father ordered that my visits stop, but I could no longer be his prized son. I asked for Celina's hand in marriage. We returned to the castle, and Father swallowed his rage for I was still irreplaceable._

_It was a good three years with Celina. You will see the calligraphy included with this letter, Edmund. I realized Celina did not know all her letters, and so I taught her. She was atrocious._

"Really, though," Edmund murmured, flicking through the paper, and Anna picked one up to inspect the admittedly badly scrawled lettering. "Looks a lot like the time Gustaf made me try."

"She improved," Anna said, waving one of the last, and Celina had, indeed, managed to write just as beautifully as Gustaf if not more. She had written a name. "Look. Odon."

_During those years, my power in the court increased as more and more flocked to my side. I did not truly imagine rebellion. I only wanted change. I wanted Father to see the error of his ways, to give up his mad quest for power, but his fascination with the Mirror could not be swayed. But still, he tolerated me if only because I was his son, the only son who had inherited his magic. It always irked him, though, that I could no longer be used. Perhaps he truly believed that he had loved me and that I had scorned him, for he was never the same. I had broken an already damaged man._

_And then, suddenly, I could be replaced._

_All the house of cards crumbled at once._

_Father had found someone new. Someone more suited for the Mirror. Perfect for it, even, born for that exact purpose. Fate has ill-treated this child. Completely by chance, they were given this gift and curse. I would have spared her from the pain if I could, but I was also selfish and did not act until one final spur._

_Because of Odon. Suddenly, there was a malleable grandson to be had, a grandson with the same gift of our lineage. Father would take Odon as my replacement, and I could not allow my son to be as ruined as me. For Odon and the Other, I rebelled. And I was defeated. If I had simply killed Father, perhaps all this madness could have been abated. But I faltered. Father returned the favor and left me to rot, and that, I think, was the greatest cruelty. Celina was exiled to Baaj, killed by something I had created. And Odon…_

_Odon stayed._

_Odon has always been here under another name._

Anna looked up. "But you said that–"

"Both Celina and Odon were sent to Baaj; I thought that was what happened! What is this…?" Edmund's head whipped up towards the painting of Celina. With one pull he tore away his bandages, revealing a bloody eye strained by dark red veins, widened with the horror of dawning realization when, for the first time, he saw their shared features. "Gustaf told me…Gustaf said…!"

_I watched Odon grow up not knowing that I was his father, that the man he did call Father had stolen him from me and killed his mother. I watched, and I said nothing. I could not. I had no place ruining the small measure of security that Odon had been given; I could not uproot his life. But perhaps I was also a coward who could not bear the responsibility. I, who had already failed once, could not bear to fail a second time. So I remained silent. I watched. And I failed all the same, all the worse._

_I am sure that you have guessed by now._

_At long last, I have done my duty to you. I tell you my story…as any father should…for their son._

_I can only hope that I am not too late. I tell you so that you might learn from me, as I once learned from your mother. Your name was Odon, but you are now Edmund and there is nothing so wrong with that. Now you know everything, but you are your own person. You can be whatever you choose to be. It was too late for me. It need not be for you._

_Choose well, Edmund._

_Goodbye…_

_Odon._

Anna jerked back when Edmund crumpled the letter. Veins pulsed in his neck as he clutched the letter in his hand, until he finally released a bloodcurdling roar and tore it to shreds, standing up so suddenly that he scattered the calligraphy paper, kicking the chest aside and screaming unintelligible words. Anna instinctively closed her eyes and flinched back, but Edmund ignored her. Instead, he rampaged around the room, destroying everything in sight, and Anna watched in trepidation as he neared the portrait of Celina. No, Anna thought. It was the portrait of his mother.

_"It's all – just – lies!_" Edmund slammed his hands onto the altar, staring into the face that was a reflection of his own, and Anna wondered if he could see the resemblance now. It only seemed to infuriate him. Snarling with primordial anger, Edmund ripped the portrait down and threw it with all his might, so powerfully that he himself stumbled and fell to the floor as the portrait hit the wall.

Its clattering was the only thing to break the silence.

And Edmund's anger finally calmed. On the floor, he took in raspy, unsteady breaths, some shallow and others deep, before curling into himself and hiding his head in his hands.

Anna approached carefully and knelt next to Edmund. When she reached out, he flinched away. Anna pulled away, murmuring, "I'm so sorry."

"…I should have known. God, I should have known."

"You couldn't have known," Anna said.

"It was obvious. Even you saw the resemblance."

"A resemblance doesn't mean anything. No one would think anything of that."

"You don't understand!" Edmund raised his head and babbled, "I should have seen. It's my fault! Don't you see? Gustaf didn't need to die. All along, I should have known, I could have had more than this–!"

"You can still hate what he's done." Anna gently placed her hand on Edmund's shoulder and he looked to her, despondent eyes practically pleading for an answer. "You can hate that he didn't tell you. It's just like he said. You can choose. You can love him and still hate what he did, Edmund."

Edmund laughed and sobbed all at once. "If only I could do that, I think I would. I really think I would, Anna. I would love him. If he had told me, I would have–!"

Anna pulled him into an embrace and Edmund cried at last.

They were tears of anger and anguish both.

**a/n:** Phew, philosophy. Absurdism is great, but more on that when Tempest is finished and I can give a proper discourse. Anyway, Elsanna coming up!
