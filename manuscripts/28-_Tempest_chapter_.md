**Chapter 28: Shattering Point**

She had no time for this.

"I have enough troubles without you adding to them," Elsa said, feeling a headache build at the base of her skull. "Do not inform me of things that I have no interest in knowing. I've told you what I want. See to it that it happens."

Saul bowed his head. "I apologize. I assumed you would want updates."

"About Hans?" Elsa frowned. "Keep him alive and healthy. Is that so difficult to achieve?"

"Easy enough to keep him alive," Saul said. "Harder to keep him healthy when he refuses to take his medicine. I have considered force-feeding him, but I thought it best to request authorization."

Stubborn fool. Hans was just as much of a nuisance now as he was when he still schemed against her, perhaps more so now that he was not an adversary but a liability. At least before she only needed to guard herself, not coddle him. Elsa might have agreed to the force-feeding and been done with it, but knowing what Anna would say if she found out about it made her think twice. For whatever reason, Anna was fond of the thirteenth prince. She would never understand what Anna saw in him, but Elsa could afford him some lenience for that alone.

"I will attend to it," Elsa said. Just as she finished speaking, a sharp pain lanced through the right side of her skull. Involuntarily, Elsa covered her eye and released a hiss through clenched teeth.

"You aren't well," Saul said, stepping forward and around to her side, hand outstretched as though to steady her. But of course he paused before he actually touched her. No one _could_ touch her. No one, except for Anna. Saul drew back. "Are you remembering to take your medicine? If you've run out, I can prescribe more–"

"No, I need something stronger." With great force of will, Elsa removed her hand from her face, brushing back a strand of hair that she'd misplaced. Whatever affliction just struck had lessened to a dull throb and, while painful, it was manageable enough.

"What you're taking is already several times more potent than I would recommend," Saul said. "Anyone else would have died."

"It doesn't matter. Whatever you give me will lose effect sooner or later as this body adjusts," Elsa said. Constant regeneration from her powers kept her alive even as she teetered on the brink of death, with her heart mangled. An upside was immunity to poison. Less convenient was a similar protection against medication. She waved off another protest. "Go. I will attend to Hans."

With that, Saul departed and after taking a few minutes to recover, Elsa also left her office. She had never lived close to the princes' wing, but as with all parts of the castle, she knew the way well. When she arrived at Hans' room, the door was closed. It would have been proper procedure for a messenger to forewarn Hans of her arrival so that he might prepare, but Elsa was pressed for time and Hans would not have bothered anyhow, not with how he was right now. But still, good manners were important. Elsa knocked on the door and waited.

"Leave," Hans said.

Elsa waved her hand and a burst of pressurized cold air shoved the door open. She had ripped it off its hinges entirely, sending the useless plank of wood flying into the wall. Hans jerked upright in bed but immediately clutched at his legs, spasm of pain making itself clear in the grimace on his face. Elsa walked into the room and took a glance around. She had never been in here. All the walls were bare, white to the point of sterility. Hans kept no personal effects in his room. It reminded her of her own.

Except it was a wreck. Jagged shards of bowls and containers littered the floor. Worse was their original contents, the rancid smell of medicine now permeating the room, staining the carpets and even the far wall; Elsa surmised that Hans had thrown them. She was honestly surprised he had the strength.

"No need to bow," Elsa said, and Hans clenched his jaw. Both of them knew he could not. "I heard that you refused your medicine."

"It's none of your concern," Hans said.

"Perhaps. But you are no stranger to interfering in matters that are none of your concern." Elsa picked her way around the room until she was at his bedside. With a wave of her hand, she conjured a chair of ice and sat. "Humor me, then."

Hans pursed his lips, though as always, he was not unnerved by her magic. Elsa guessed that he simply wanted her gone. Funny. It had always been him irritating her with his presence. Now that the tables were turned, there was something to be said for being an unwanted guest and setting the host on edge. She could see why he enjoyed it so.

"You'd best humor yourself," Hans said. "If I'm lucky, I won't be around much longer."

"Are you so eager to throw your life away?"

"Yes." Hans looked to Elsa for a fraction of a second, but when Elsa met his gaze he looked away just as quickly. With his head bowed, he muttered, "I thought you would be pleased to let me rot."

"I would be more than happy to do just that," Elsa admitted. "But you were born of Markus, and I will not let you die."

"So you would preserve me because of my father?" Hans snorted. "You can let me die, then. Father wouldn't care. No one would care about my passing. No one…will miss me."

"I have no time for your self-pity," Elsa said, and a muscle twitched in Hans' jaw. "I will have you force-fed if that is what it takes. Do not think that you can die without my express permission."

"Do you have any right to stop me?" Hans snarled. "What life am I throwing away, except for one that was wretched from the start and doomed to oblivion now?"

Elsa frowned. "All I see that is wretched here is you."

"You have no right. You have _everything_, and you've never suffered for it!" Hans said. "You were born with magic. You were brought here and raised to be queen. What about me? I was born only to be treated as trash by my brothers, as disposable by my father. Even after my mother gave her life for me, I was still thrown to the wayside and my birthright handed over to you! She gave her life, and for nothing! You have no right–"

Elsa laughed.

"You are pitiful," Elsa said, still laughing with frigid derision while Hans whipped his head around to glare ineffectually. Elsa met his gaze and her laughs faded, her lips curling with distaste. "I don't like you, but I have never looked down on you. I respected your cunning, at least. But today, I find that you're nothing but a pitiful wretch who seeks out sympathy with your sob story. It's _pathetic_, Hans."

Hans clenched his fists, breathing harshly, and his eyes snapped shut for a brief moment before flying wide open. Elsa saw the fury in his eyes but paid him no heed, and she felt herself sneer without conscious thought. If Hans thought he had anything to complain about, then she would gladly invite him to live her life.

"Pathetic?" Elsa watched as Hans made some ineffectual motion or another. Likely he forgot that he could no longer walk and wanted to rise, to strike, but instead he settled for glaring. "Do you think I care about your opinion, you, the one with common blood running throu–"

"And there we have it," Elsa interjected. "All the while you complain, you revel over your identity as a prince of the Southern Isles. As though you could ever let go of the power it brings you. What is it that you really want? What do you hope to accomplish by telling me your sad life story? If you think any of this excuses you of all your meddling, your plotting, your sending your brothers to their deaths…" Elsa seized Hans by the collar and dragged him close. "You are wrong."

Elsa shoved Hans away and he fell back, his feeble rage scattered and replaced by a mixture of terror and confusion. Suddenly Elsa understood what Gustaf had said, though not about herself but about Hans. It was not his shattered legs that reduced him, not his broken body that caged him.

It was denial.

"Go ahead. Pretend like you're avenging your mother," Elsa said, and Hans flinched. "I have never met the woman. I only know about her in passing, but even I know that she wouldn't have agreed with what you were doing in her name. Could you, her son, really think otherwise? Do you think you wanted the throne for any reason other than your own lust for power? It was always for yourself."

"No. It was for her. Everything was for–"

"You don't even remember. She had common blood too."

Hans opened his mouth, but he made no sound and a moment later, his lips closed. Elsa saw the bob in his throat as he swallowed, and then Hans looked away, muttering, "Leave. Just leave. I'm already in this state. Just dying would be better than surviving."

"If you still want to die, I won't stop you. It's easy to die," Elsa said. "But you really will have led a worthless life if you let yourself die now."

Hans slumped back wordlessly.

Without another glance at the prince, Elsa strode out of his room. She eyed the ruined door and repressed a sigh. She would need to find someone to fix it. It was likely Saul's fault, anyway. His medication for her headaches, while effective, left her on edge and prone to recklessness. Fitting punishment that he mend the door. At least his architectural talent would not be wasted.

Elsa walked out the door.

She was not expecting to see Anna standing off to the side.

Anna was clutching the edge of the doorway with both hands. Their eyes met, Elsa blinked, and Anna shrugged with a weak smile on her face. Without prompting, Elsa followed Anna down the hallway. They continued the rest of the walk to their room in silence, but from behind, Elsa observed. Something was different about Anna. She had always been brave, but not confident, not like this. Brashness hid her insecurities well enough, but Elsa knew Anna thought too little of herself. She had never possessed the sort of determined self-assurance her squared shoulders showed now, as though heading into a war.

Once they arrived, Anna closed the door.

* * *

It was too quiet even for Elsa.

They were not _particularly_ quiet, at least not in comparison to the silence that so often plagued their time together nowadays. Elsa rarely knew what to say, and Anna seemed to have finally given up on dragging out conversation. But there was at least some modicum of understanding before. They both had much on their minds, much that could not be given form in words. Now, the silence was stifling. Elsa knew Anna wanted to speak and yet she would not, could not, and that was the real difference.

At last, Elsa asked, "Is everything all right?"

"Yeah," Anna said, but the tenseness never left her shoulders. "Yeah. Nothing's wrong, I just – I just wanted to talk. If you're not busy, I mean. Is that okay?"

"Of course," Elsa said.

She fell silent again, waiting for Anna to continue, but contrary to her expectation, the redhead said nothing. It was unlike the Anna she was familiar with, discounting the last few days. Anna should have been able to keep talking and talking, and even if Elsa would never find her irritating, even she had to admit that Anna possessed practically inexhaustible energy. Silence was unlike her, especially when by her own admission, she _wanted_ to talk–

"Are you just going to ignore me again?" Anna asked sharply.

"...What?" Elsa shook her head, too confused to say anything more elaborate, too surprised to correct her undignified response. "I don't understand."

"No, I'm just being – I'm just saying – Forget it." Anna cut herself off with a deep sigh. "Let me start over. I practiced this in my head too, I don't know why I'm screwing it all up–"

"You don't have to practice at all," Elsa said. "You can tell me anything."

"…Okay."

Maybe Anna had found her words encouraging, or maybe she had found them as weak as Elsa herself did. She couldn't tell. But the next moment, Anna crossed over to their bed and sat down on its edge, taking a deep breath and biting her lip before patting the spot next to her. Befuddled, Elsa claimed a seat. Anna still wasn't looking directly at her, but the instant she sat, Anna exhaled as though relieved.

"I just feel like we haven't been talking much," Anna said, maintaining her staring contest with the opposite wall, nervously playing with the edge of the blankets. But at the very least, she was no longer stammering. Quietly but very clearly, she added, "And I missed you."

"I thought that you wouldn't want to be around me," Elsa said.

Anna whipped her head around, eyes widened with such complete and utter confusion that Elsa knew she had been wrong long before any denial left her lips. It did nothing to comfort Elsa. If anything, the sight sparked a kindle of anger in her that she never even knew existed.

"It wasn't like that," Anna said.

"So _what_ was it, then?" Elsa asked, fighting back a surge of frustration, but the stress bottled up behind her facade was too much to contain. Not for lack of self-control. She could have continued on like this indefinitely. She _had_ been like this for the better part of her years, containing her emotions and never allowing herself to feel anything at all, but for better or worse _Anna_, Anna was the one person who could make her lose control. "You've been silent. You've avoided me. I want to know _why_, Anna. If it wasn't what I believed, then why?"

"I've been silent because _you_ don't want to listen to me. I've avoided you because _you_ don't want to see me." Elsa opened her mouth to speak, but Anna cut her off. "Have you never once noticed that I've been trying? Can you really tell me you've never pushed me away?"

It had been a long time, too long, but Elsa had convinced herself that they both needed some time to themselves. Distance seemed prudent after their difference in opinion made itself glaringly obvious, and she had believed that Anna thought so too when she failed to meet with her in the office as per their usual routine. It was the first day after her return. Elsa waited in her office the entire day, trying to busy herself with work but unable to concentrate, restless as she waited for the door to swing open, but the entire day passed without any sign of Anna.

Elsa had been afraid of pushing Anna away even further than she already had.

Apparently her efforts to avoid it had done just that.

"From the moment you got back, you pushed me away." Anna had said she practiced this speech. Elsa could see that any practice had been discarded as angry tears welled in her eyes, as Anna tried to blink them back and failed, as her voice wavered and broke. "I've been trying–"

"Haven't I been trying as well? I've always been here, waiting, but you choose the others over me." Elsa stood and walked away from the bed, away from Anna, refusing to let herself back down. "Edmund, Alek, I can understand. Fine. But Hans? Hans has been nothing but a thorn in my side, and from what I'm told, almost caused your death–"

"And he also saved my life!"

"You should never have been there in the first place!" Elsa whirled around and strode towards Anna, knowing that her powers were raging under the surface, but the redhead never faltered. Even now, Anna was not afraid. "I would never have exposed you to danger, I would have kept you safe–"

"By taking advice from Saul and locking me up?"

"If that were what it took!"

"_Why can't you just be there for me when I need you!_"

Elsa stilled. Even Anna seemed to be at the end of her strength, her tears falling freely but silently, even as the echoes of her last word rang with the force of thunder. It was true, Elsa knew it was true and she could not deny it any longer, could not shift the blame to anyone. Anna had needed her, and despite all her promises she had failed to keep her safe. And after coming back, she had done nothing to give Anna the slightest bit of security. She had expected Anna to do the work as usual.

"I'm sorry." Elsa stepped closer and tentatively reached out. Anna did nothing to stop her, and Elsa carefully wiped the tears from her face. Reclaiming her seat next to Anna, Elsa said quietly, "I'm sorry I've been distant."

"It's not your fault. We were both just…waiting for the other person to do something." Anna cleared her throat, and Elsa looked down to the floor. She noticed that Anna was kicking her feet back and forth, the tips of her boots curled upwards minusculely.

"It shouldn't have fallen to you."

"That's not how it works. It's on both of us."

"I was afraid," Elsa said, and that might have been all she could manage had Anna not looked at her questioningly. She deserved to know. "I'm always afraid, and only of one thing. I don't ever want to lose you. I thought if I ignored all this, never brought this up, then we would be fine."

"I-I didn't realize."

Elsa hummed in the back of her throat, and silence fell again. Now Anna was busy tapping her fingers on the bedding. Elsa sat with her hands in her lap, but her eyes flicked over to watch the rhythmic up and down oscillation of Anna's fingers. She realized she had not held Anna's hand in days, the entire week, even. Elsa turned away, and she saw herself. Without her knowing, her hand had clenched shut. Elsa looked away and closed her eyes. She wanted to reach out. More than anything, she wanted to, but with this past week between them–

Warmth brushed against her knuckles, and Elsa reflexively opened her hand.

Anna jerked away. "Sorry! I should've asked first, I'm such an idiot–"

Elsa reached out and took Anna's hand.

"Of course you are," Elsa said, gently rapping her knuckle on Anna's forehead and smiling when the redhead rubbed at the spot with a confused pout on her face. "You should know I won't mind." But she knew she was the biggest fool of all for not reaching out sooner. She had missed this warmth, so much.

Slowly, Anna's confusion shifted into a smile. She wrapped her free arm around Elsa's waist and put her head on her shoulder, snuggling closer with a small laugh of delight. Elsa brushed her hand over Anna's hair and placed a chaste kiss on the top of her head, but she nearly jumped when she felt a nip on her neck in response. Elsa pulled away and fixed Anna with a stare, but she was met only by a mischievous smile and eyes curved upwards into crescents.

"You can't blame me."

"I suppose not."

"I really missed you."

"I did too."

Everything standing between them melted away. It was like surfacing from the pitch-black depths of the sea, and Elsa could breathe again. All the frustration clouding her head, all the doubt plaguing her thoughts, all of it suddenly seemed as insubstantial as smoke. None of that was as real and tangible as having Anna here in her arms, breathing in her familiar scent and seeing her wide smile. What more was there to think about than this present moment?

"Do you know," Elsa murmured, thumbing the strand of white hair marring Anna's otherwise red tresses, "I destroyed five entire scores of training posts this past week?"

"Wow. I guess you really needed to vent."

"I needed something to distract me. I thought I would upset you if I actually caused any casualties, so those posts had to bear the brunt of my restlessness."

"Poor things."

"I obliterated them," Elsa agreed, and Anna snorted. "It's true. Electricity comes easier now, and there are times when the lightning surges so powerfully it almost leaves my control. It seems the worse my headaches become, the more power I can channel."

"Your headaches are getting worse?" Anna pulled away and examined her closely. "Is everything all right? I'm so sorry, I didn't even think about asking–"

"Ever since Weselton…" Elsa made a halfhearted attempt at warding off Anna but eventually allowed her to get closer, feeling the warmth spread from where Anna's fingers kneaded her temples to her entire body. Just a simple touch from Anna could do more than any of the medications she took. "You don't have to worry, but thank you."

"You're working too much," Anna said. "So what exactly were you doing in the office, then?"

"Containment. What happened in the Outer Districts and the warehouse needed to be dealt with," Elsa said. She regretted her bluntness the moment Anna stilled. "There was growing unrest."

"Oh." Anna blinked and pulled away, brushing her hair as Elsa watched with head tilted to one side. Strange. Anna only did that when…

"Something is bothering you."

"Nothing. I was just wondering about your dress." Anna made a big show of eyeing the unfamiliar garment, but it wasn't the floaty fabric that interested her most. "What color would you say that is?"

"…Blue?" Elsa glanced down at her dress and made the tiniest of frowns, her version of a shrug.

"Nah. Definitely periwinkle," Anna muttered. When she looked up again, she made a face. "But really, _blue_ is the best you can come up with?"

"I _made_ this."

"And you don't even know what color it is," Anna said, shaking her head, and Elsa very almost rolled her eyes. "All right, I have another test for you. What color is my hair–?"

"Red," Elsa said, but before Anna could refute her with some far-off, obscure color, she added, "There's something else you want to talk to me about."

Anna sobered quickly. Elsa regretted cutting their banter short, but the more rational part of her, the part that dominated every other aspect of her life, told her that some matters could not be avoided. Sometimes a small voice in her head that sounded suspiciously like Anna would chide her that matters of the heart could not be reasoned through with cold logic and careful calculation, and she wished she could obey. But Elsa had fallen back on thinking with her head and not her heart for so long that rationality was second nature. It had been her companion long before Anna entered her life. It was easy, and familiar, more familiar, sometimes, than Anna.

It was just another mask she wore, and she wore it gladly.

* * *

Did she want to bring it up?

Without even realizing her habit resurfacing, Anna bit her lip and brushed her hair behind her ear. Elsa was considerate enough to give her time to think, but the blank face and void stare she affixed her with made Anna even more anxious. She was suddenly another person altogether from the Elsa who had been sitting in that same spot and playing with her hair. If Anna had not seen this side of Elsa before and witnessed her shifting demeanor before her eyes, she might have said that someone was very badly impersonating Elsa. But no, because truth was _this_ was the Elsa she had first met.

And this Elsa was a result of the reliquary.

Anna just didn't know how to broach the subject.

"What's going on with the Outer Districts?" Anna asked.

"Malcontents," Elsa said, with a voice so carefully neutral that Anna knew she was dissatisfied. "As you know, the Sorcerer was not particularly subtle about his tastes. Now that rumors are spreading, the commoners are demanding justice."

"…All the families must be devastated."

Anna had embarked on that foolhardy quest with a mind to save those who had been taken. In the end she had saved no one. There had been no one _to_ save, not amidst that graveyard of mangled bodies and discarded corpses. Just the memory alone was enough to send a shudder wracking through her body. How much did the people know? If they knew what had really transpired down there in the cold and the dark, there would be absolute mayhem. But at the same time, they deserved to know.

"What do you plan on doing?" Anna asked. Elsa said nothing, only fixed her with a questioning stare, and Anna added, "Don't the people deserve some sort of explanation?"

"What would I tell them?"

"Well, the truth."

"No truth will be enough to satisfy the commoners. It was an oversight on my part, I admit," Elsa said. "But telling them the truth would only incite more discontent. Nor would they understand."

"Have you been down there?" Anna asked. "All those people, kidnapped and tortured. You have to tell their families what happened, and at least give them a proper burial–"

"Burial? It's impossible to retrieve the bodies, not after the explosion completely caved in the warehouse basement. Everything down there has been destroyed, and good riddance."

It was the flippant way Elsa said all this that set Anna on edge. Not necessarily what she was saying, because as horrible as it was, she could see why telling dozens of families their loved ones had been experimented on might be even worse than sparing them the gritty details. And even retrieving the bodies of the victims might really be impossible, even ill-advised, considering what had been done to them, but Elsa…

Elsa sounded as though she cared nothing for their suffering. Instead, she spoke of the people living in the Outer Districts, _commoners_, with ill-concealed contempt, and of the victims as though they were not victims at all or even people. She had even called them _bodies_ like they had never lived and dreamed.

"So you're not going to do anything but try and hide all the evidence?" Anna asked.

"It's not what you're thinking," Elsa sighed. "Believe me that this is the best course of action. All of this will be forgotten with time, and their lives will continue without disturbance."

"People died, Elsa. Innocent people who had their lives stolen from them," Anna said. "One man told me about his daughter who loved to explore, and another woman told me about a girl who would sing as she walked by her home–"

"What are you trying to say?"

"I'm saying that these were real people who died. Not just commoners or bodies, but people, and they deserve better. I _know_ you care," Anna said, "I know you do, or you wouldn't do so much, you wouldn't have regular supply caravans–"

"Anna, I don't care."

"…What?"

Anna could hardly believe her ears. She must have heard wrong. She had always been taught that a monarch was to guide and protect their people, and of all the lessons she had been forced to sit through, that one always made the most sense. And to hear that Elsa simply _didn't care_ about the people she ruled, the people she was supposed to be protecting?

But the more she thought about it, she realized she should have realized sooner. If Elsa had cared, she wouldn't have allowed those horrible living conditions. She wouldn't have failed to notice all the disappearances right beneath her nose. She wouldn't have thought nothing of them and done nothing.

"Pain cannot be alleviated," Elsa said. "At one point, I thought I could do something for them. I thought I could make their lives better, but the truth is that there is nothing I can do. Life itself is a cruel joke, and as I learned that lesson, I came to realize. People hurt because they care. I decided to stop–"

"How do you just _decide_ to stop?" Anna murmured.

"It was easy."

"Because you became heartless."

Anna realized what she had said just a moment too late, just a moment after the words had already left her mouth. She had never meant to say it aloud. She had never meant it to have the particular context that Elsa would understand it as, but it was too late. Elsa stared at her, shell-shocked and silent, and Anna could do and say nothing in response. Nothing would ever suffice to make this better.

"I-I'm sorry. I need to go," Anna said.

She fled.

Elsa never pursued, but Anna ran out of her room and away, away to nowhere, away to anywhere that was not where she would need to think of the irreparable damage she had just caused. She had never meant to say it. She had never meant it that way–

**_But you did._**

_But I did._

She had always thought that Elsa was similar to the Sorcerer. What if there was something more to her fears? She remembered that he had mentioned his heart was crumbling away, that it was sapping both his emotion and his life. It was happening to Elsa too. It was already beginning; Anna knew that better than anyone. Elsa was so terribly broken. Her heart had _splintered_ until a piece attached itself to Anna.

**_She will become like me._**

_She will become like him._

**_And then_ **_**she will** __**die.**_

Such a wave of panic struck her then that she could barely stay on her feet. It felt as though some suffocating thing had latched onto her every thought and filled her throat, her lungs. Anna slid down a wall, gasping for breath as her thoughts flew in every direction. She had to do something. But there was nothing she could do, she was helpless, she was too late to do anything–

**_You have to try._**

She had to try.

**_Go see it one more time._**

She had to see one more time.

**_You know what you have to do, Anna._**

She had to go to the reliquary and set things right.
