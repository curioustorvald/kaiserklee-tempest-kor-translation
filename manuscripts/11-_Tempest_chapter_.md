**Chapter 11: There Lay An Invincible Summer**

Her seal was gone.

Even if she hadn't been able to feel the seal unraveling before, Elsa could see it now from where she stood on the staircase, her ice melted away to reveal the chamber entrance; but somehow _seeing_ it was worse. Now she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Anna had gone through. She hardly dared to continue for fear of what she might see.

And then she heard a scream.

Not Anna.

Tobias stumbled out of the chamber, flailing and screaming as he clutched his blackened, burned hand, and Elsa knew he had tried to take her reliquary by force. A fool, to covet her gift. Even separated, her heart knew its master. No one but her could approach, not while it was safeguarded by impenetrable ice. When Tobias caught sight of Elsa, he nearly tumbled down the steps in his haste to reach her.

"Elsa!" Tobias fell to his knees, face twisting with horror as frostbite crept up his arm. "How do I stop this? Tell me how to stop this! Help me! I don't want to die; I don't want to die, please–"

She had no time for this. Elsa wanted nothing more than to leave Tobias to his fate; but whatever happened, he was still one of Markus's children. And _saving_ him was punishment in and of itself.

With a flick of her hand, a thin sheet of ice sliced through his arm at the elbow.

Tobias opened his mouth in a silent scream, emitting no sound despite the agony clear in his muddled eyes. His remaining hand flew to the stump left behind, frozen over without a drop of blood, and his entire body trembled as he inched towards the severed limb. Then the pain became too much. His eyes rolled backwards and he collapsed.

Elsa didn't spare him another glance.

_Anna._

She sped up the rest of the steps and burst into the chamber.

Anna was lying on the ground, either unconscious or – Elsa couldn't bear to think of the alternative. She had to be alive. She _had_ to be. Elsa rushed over and dropped down without a second thought. But now that she was here, Elsa realized she had no idea what to do. Her hand reached out, trembling with hesitation that she only ever felt around Anna, before she stilled. What if she hurt Anna even more?

Before her eyes, a streak of white grew in Anna's hair.

"No," Elsa whispered. "No, Anna. You can't just leave me like this. I only just – I only just started feeling again, please, _please_…"

Loneliness.

Elsa realized now that loneliness was the bitterness choking her every waking thought, like a suffocating vine that snaked around her mind. She had thought herself superior, but she was only alone. She had thought herself numb, but she was only in despair. Agony lurked under her facade, and it cut so deeply every color had bled out of life. Hers was a prolonged half-life in washed-out black and white.

Until she found Anna, and her world exploded into color.

"I need you. I need you, Anna. Wake up."

Nothing except for a violent shudder that wracked through Anna's body, and Elsa let go of her doubt. Elsa drew Anna into her arms and cradled her head, but she felt nothing like the Anna that Elsa knew. Anna was warm, not this icy creature with cold skin and whitened hair. Anna was bright, not this paling, bloodless imitation. She used to be so full of life…

"You can't die," Elsa said. She pulled Anna closer, and now she could hear the pulse of her reliquary beating in time with Anna's heart. A tiny shard had separated and lodged itself into the warmth it craved. "I won't let you die."

Elsa placed a hand over Anna's heart and tried to draw out the sliver of ice, but the moment it responded to her call – Anna curled inwards, face screwed-up with indescribable agony, and Elsa stopped immediately. She couldn't control it. Not since making her reliquary had she been capable of fine control, and if she tried to force it she might kill Anna right then and there. She was useless.

"What can I do…?"

Elsa held Anna tighter when frost began to coat her skin, when her fingertips began to turn blue. She was fading fast. If this went on…Anna would…

"Anna!"

Was this loss she felt, the tingling at her fingertips, the prickling at her eyes? She could hardly bear to look at Anna, cold and lifeless, but she couldn't draw her eyes away either.

"You can't die," Elsa whispered. "You can't die without my permission. Wake up! Wake up, right now!"

For the first time in thirteen years, Elsa let herself cry and pray for a miracle.

Behind her, the Mirror glowed.

* * *

"Welcome to your new home."

For all of her clumsiness and distinct lack of regality, Anna was still royalty and had lived in Arendelle Castle all her life. Not to mention she had already seen the Southern Isles Castle, the one perfected by Elsa; so when Markus showed off the original, Anna glanced over the common stone and mortar and then looked back to the child trailing behind Markus.

She could see why Elsa was impressed. For a commoner from the outskirts of the kingdom, seeing the castle up close must have been like something out of a dream, and to one day actually live in it? Not even a dream but a fantasy. Elsa followed with her lips slightly parted, eyes wide open in childish awe, and it was hard to imagine the cold queen she would one day become.

"R-Really?" Elsa asked. "But I'm nothing special, Your Majesty–"

"Never say that about yourself again, Elsa," Markus said sternly, and he fixed her with a heavy gaze. When she nodded, looking absolutely terrified, his eyes softened. "And you do not need to address me with any title. You may call me by name."

"I can't do that! It's too rude!" Elsa exclaimed.

"From today on, you are royalty as you were always meant to be." Before Elsa could protest more, Markus showed her inside and Elsa was silenced by what was, to her, unimaginable wealth.

Anna followed as Markus led Elsa to where she knew was the throne room. Maybe she was around the paranoid Elsa too much, but she wondered about this kind, fatherly figure. Markus just so happened to conveniently be around to pick up the pieces when Elsa broke? In the future Elsa had always spoken of Markus with reverence, but in spite of that – perhaps _because_ of that – Anna watched the happenings unfold with a grain of salt.

When the grand doors opened, they were greeted by the thirteen princes standing at attention. Elsa shied away, unused to human interaction and taught to fear harming them, but Markus straightened her back and walked with her to the front of the hall. Thirteen pairs of curious eyes watched Elsa as she was allowed to stand above the dais and directly to Markus's right, an honor even they were denied.

"Let me introduce you to Elsa. From today on, she will be Princess Elsa of the Southern Isles," Markus said. Ignoring the hushed muttering that his announcement provoked, he continued, "And you are to make Elsa feel welcomed and at home. Introduce yourselves."

One by one, Anna watched as they made their introductions. Gustaf was already in his twenties and looked bemused by the whole thing, but some of the others were not as kind. Tobias looked as though he had swallowed something sour, and Anna felt a surge of vindictive pleasure to see Markus reprimand him. Most were generally uninterested, though Anna was amused to see a young Edmund introduce himself with such vigor that Elsa nodded almost fearfully. Hans was as composed as ever.

And Saul, true to his word, was instantly enamored. Anna watched with a growing scowl as Saul stammered through his greeting, and she was even more displeased to see Elsa grin at the boy. She had never smiled at _her_ like that before. Saul smiled back, seemingly relieved, and retreated with a suave bow that looked ten times more practiced.

"She just feels bad for you, lover-boy," Anna muttered.

The memory stopped midway through Markus ordering whoever to show Elsa around, and Anna waited patiently for whatever the reliquary decided to show her next. As the vision steadied, Anna wondered if she was getting too comfortable with the whole ordeal.

Not much time had passed. Elsa looked to be the same age and was seated at the back of a classroom, looking unbelievably bored by the lecture from a bespectacled old man. Anna noticed how she sat with a rigidly straight back now, and Elsa didn't rest her chin on her hand like other children might, instead staring straight ahead with her chin held high. She was already being trained to be royal. Still, Anna could see her eyes glazed over, and she grinned when Elsa tried to stay awake by pinching her thigh.

When a small break was announced, the others of Elsa's age group – from Rafael, the seventh prince, down to Edmund and Hans – shuffled out for some desperately needed air. Elsa stayed behind and shook her head twice before perusing a thick textbook, one hand rubbing at her temple all the while. A few minutes later, Elsa pushed the book away. After looking around almost guiltily, Elsa moved her hands together in a slow revolution, wisps of blue swirling around her fingertips.

And then she created.

Right there on the table a miniature palace came to life, from the foundations pushing upwards into tall spires to even details like individual windows and doors and markings. It was somehow more impressive to see a child crafting something so intricate, but then Anna realized she had never seen Elsa do anything like this when she was older and she wondered if, as Elsa had implied, she could no longer.

Anna was so engrossed she didn't notice someone coming back in. Apparently neither did Elsa, because she jumped when the voice said, "That's beautiful, you know."

Immediately, Elsa stopped and the castle's development halted. Whirling around and frightened eyes no doubt expecting admonishment, Elsa was instead met by Saul looking on with effusive admiration.

"I-I'm sorry?"

"You're an architect," Saul said with wonder, walking closer and tracing the ice. Elsa smiled widely at the unexpected praise before schooling her features to neutrality, but her half-practiced mask shattered when Saul added, "All of this is perfect down to the last detail. How do you manage it?"

"I just visualize," Elsa blurted out. "I mean, I never start out with anything fixed, I have an idea and then–"

"You let it design itself," Saul finished, wide smile matching the one on Elsa's face exactly. "Inspiration and then uninterrupted flow."

"Yes! It's all about maths and geometry, but you can't let rules constrain you!" Elsa practically glowed with excitement. Even her voice was rising into a squeak, and when Elsa realized she covered her mouth with her hand. "Oh, I'm sorry. I got carried away."

"No, I understand! I also design. Smaller things, of course, nothing of your scale and certainly having barely a fraction of your beauty," Saul said. Anna scowled. Even young, Saul was dramatic.

But to Anna's eternal shock, Elsa looked away with a blush. "I've seen some of your work, I really admire it. Especially your ships! You actually use your hands, but I feel like I'm cheating."

Saul reached out and tapped the ice palace with a nail, letting the melodic ring sound out before he spoke again. "It's not cheating to have a gift. What's talent if not meant to be used? I wish I were capable of half of what you can do."

"What I wouldn't give for Edmund's talent right now," Elsa said, smiling crookedly as she looked towards the textbooks. "I'm so far behind all of you…"

"Eidetic memory? Being able to memorize with a glance _is_ useful," Saul admitted. "I do believe he's gone through the entire library already."

Anna raised an eyebrow. That sounded nothing like the Edmund she knew. Maybe he had hit his head some time in between?

"Though we all have our talents – Rafael with music, Alek with sword. So you see, your gift is not so different after all," Saul said. He slid the textbook back around. "Now then, I shall endeavor to help you conquer this. Maths is preferable, but history is not so dull if fleshed in with more than dry fact…"

Anna made a face when the memory spiraled into grey. She didn't dislike Saul anymore, but at this rate she might slip back into thinking he was a prick. When she realized where her thoughts were going, she groaned aloud at the continued reminder of her weird…thing…with Elsa.

A few more sparse memories, each one lasting less than a minute as time fast-forwarded, but it seemed like Saul was one of the few constants in Elsa's life. As children, Saul taught Elsa the correct way to use the dizzying number of utensils at a royal table. Slightly older, Saul mapped out blueprints and Elsa pulled them from the page into reality, the both of them sharing in breathless excitement. And as much as it pained Anna to see a teenaged Elsa being taught how to _dance_ by none other than Saul, the both of them smiling nervously and laughing just a bit too much when Elsa finally, _finally_ slipped up just once…

Anna was still glad to see Elsa happy.

And then the next memory started.

"Release…"

"Let free…"

"There are no limits," Elsa finished.

Elsa stood with Markus in the courtyard, the man standing behind as Elsa took deep breaths and stared down a scarecrow. Much contrary to her mantra, she extended her hands tentatively and the arc of snow that struck her target barely even bent it back. Anna noticed Markus frowning so heavily that the lines on his forehead creased.

"You are not allowing yourself to be free," Markus chided. "Do not fear your powers. Embrace them. Within you is immeasurable power, Elsa, if you would only let it go."

"I don't want to hurt anyone," Elsa said.

"Then others will inevitably hurt you. The world is hateful and cruel and will destroy whatever they cannot understand. You are not inexperienced in this."

Anna saw red at that jibe. How could anyone bring up Elsa's abuse just to prove a point? And what kind of point was he even trying to make? Just because some people might be like that didn't mean the whole world was out for blood–

But it worked. Elsa turned back to the scarecrow, eyes hardened with steel, and this time when she struck, the wave of white that burst from her fingertips snapped the wooden stand apart like a twig and left scattered straw strewn all around like lifeblood. But not even that stopped the avalanche. It surged forward, building as it moved across the courtyard, and then finally struck the castle wall with a thunderous thud. When the snow receded, Anna saw a large crater left behind.

"Now you see what you can do, and this is only the beginning," Markus said, smiling with self-satisfaction. Elsa breathed deeply and stared at her handiwork, then back to her hands, as though in disbelief that she could really summon up that much force.

Years passed in a blur of memory, each one only the seconds long.

All Anna caught from them was the growth of Elsa's power, from that first memory onward to greater and greater heights, more and more uncharted regions of her potential explored. Under Markus, Elsa learned how to channel all of her power. Anna watched Elsa learn to create snowstorms, summon gargantuan avalanches and acres of razor-sharp penitentes, until one day…

A much more regal Elsa stood before her now, as tall as Anna and twice as graceful. She stood alone in the center of the courtyard, eyes closed as she took carefully measured breaths. A sharp whistle was the only warning before crossbow bolts came from all directions. Anna knew she couldn't be hurt but instinctively raised her arms as if to block; Elsa snapped her eyes open and waved her hand in an arc, releasing a swell of ice ribboning around her to intercept. She stomped her foot on the ground and the arrows ejected in the opposite direction, back to the mounted contraptions, each one easily punching through the crossbow.

"Swords!"

At Markus's order, a troop of fifty armed guards attacked. Anna watched in awe as the teenaged Elsa drew a blade of ice and matched them blow for blow, weaving through their ranks effortlessly and slashing and cutting and parrying and riposting. She looked like she was dancing instead of fighting; Elsa could fight better than most men could _breathe_. She moved quickly, inhumanly so, all sharp pivots and turns as a gale from her offhand pushed her along at speeds no one could match, as the icy ground shifted to coordinate with her every move.

Fifty trained soldiers against a single girl.

It was horribly one-sided.

A mountain of ice rose beneath her feet, and it elevated Elsa above those who still stood before her. A strange thought flit across Anna's mind at the sight. With the light of the sun behind her, standing tall atop a glacial peak and with her eyes closed in the picture of serenity, Elsa looked like a goddess.

It didn't last. Such inhumane rage twisted Elsa's features in the next second that the goddess was replaced by a demon, and her opened eyes reflected some primal frenzy like a cornered animal. Out of clear blue skies came first drifting snow and then a howling blizzard. Just like that time when she was still young, Anna thought sadly. Markus had taught her to hate, and he had taught her well. Electricity crackled in her hands, a bolt of white-blue energy that lanced out to sear through the earth. Torrents of lightning and ice spiraled into a maelstrom, and no one could withstand its fury.

Elsa lowered herself to the ground and crushed the sword in her hand once all of her attackers were incapacitated. From the balcony where he had watched, Markus clapped slowly. Elsa looked up with glowing pride, the smile on her face so wide it reached from ear to ear.

"But you did not kill any of them," Markus said.

_That_ was a surprise, but a welcome one. Anna took a closer look at the soldiers, and to her relief, all of them were still alive. Some unconscious and the others groaning from their new sets of bruises, but alive. Elsa still had that restraint, at least.

"I didn't think it necessary," Elsa said. Anna marveled at the change in her tone. She sounded so _confident_ now, in the same quiet way of the present-day Elsa. Gone was the meek commoner girl.

"Remember that they are lesser than you, and if they should fall, that is only a result of their ineptitude," Markus said. "Have you forgotten already what I taught you?"

Elsa shook her head. "Release, let free. There are no limits."

Once more, the world shifted.

This time, Anna was greeted by the tower and thought for a second that she was back in the present. But no, Elsa and Markus were there too. Elsa was just a little bit older again, taller than Anna now and composed to faultlessness. She stood at attention with her hands folded together as Markus trudged with great effort to the mirror.

And it was obvious to her that Markus was growing old. His short hair was gray, and ever-deepening lines creased on his forehead. His eyes were starting to sink in, rimmed with red and resembling hollow caverns. Though he still possessed an unmistakable air of power, age was taking its toll.

"This, Elsa, is the project I need you to complete for me," Markus said. He spoke with a dry tone far from the smooth, sinuous charisma he used to possess. "It is an old legend, the Mirror."

"I hear and I obey," Elsa said.

"Legend says that a drop of moonlight once fell from the sky and froze the small pond that received it. That would become the Mirror, something powerful, something wondrous. It reflected…the heart's desire," Markus said, voice enraptured as though the very idea revived him. "This is that very Mirror." Markus lovingly ran a hand over the rim before doubling over into hacking coughs wet with blood.

"Markus–"

Proud, Markus was. He held up a hand and Elsa silenced. "But as you can see, the Mirror is no longer intact. But not destroyed, only fragmented. Its shards reside all over the world, and even smaller splinters are embedded in the human heart. Once, I sought to complete it, but I grow too old, Elsa. I leave the task to you. Watch! It resonates with your power."

At Markus's beckoning, Elsa extended a hand forward. Light shined from the markings on the Mirror's rim and the frame began rotating slowly, starting and stopping with a series of heavy clicks. An image appeared before them of the Mirror completed, kaleidoscope snowflake spinning at its core and blue fire running across its veins. When Elsa lowered her hand the Mirror dimmed and faltered, and the image dissipated. She looked to Markus in question, but he provided no answer to her query.

"I will die soon, so I leave it to you to complete the Mirror."

"But you said there was a way for me to save you!" Elsa said.

Markus nodded, smiling softly. "Even in its state, the Mirror can preserve my life if combined with your powers. If you were to keep my body frozen, when the Mirror has accumulated enough strength you could revive me. But…"

"I can do it, I can save you," Elsa said quickly.

"As you are, you are not strong enough to do this," Markus said. Hesitantly, turning slightly to the side and looking away from Elsa, he murmured, "Though there is another way…"

Elsa stepped forward. "Whatever it is, I'll do it."

Markus smiled sadly. "No, child, it is too large a sacrifice for me to ask."

"Nothing is too large a sacrifice," Elsa said.

Anna had an inkling of what Markus was talking about. Tobias had mentioned it, that the reliquary was being used to keep him alive. Anna clenched her fists as she realized what a cruel game this man was playing, making a show of being reluctant when he was playing Elsa in the worst way possible. Why else would he bring it up in the first place?

"If you were to make a reliquary, you would be powerful enough. Like a lens focusing light, it would give the Mirror power to sustain me." Markus shook his head. "But it is too much to ask. You know what it means to create a reliquary."

"Don't fall for it," Anna muttered. She stood in between them and tried to grab Elsa by the shoulders, but her hands passed through. "Don't fall for it! He's trying to trick you–"

"I'll do it," Elsa said immediately.

"Child–"

"Nothing is as important as your life," Elsa interrupted, and Markus, Anna was furious to see, stared with such genuine sorrow that it made her sick. "I see no drawback to a reliquary. If it can save you, then I'll do it."

Markus shook his head. "There is much you do not know, Elsa."

"I do know. It's going to suppress my emotions." Elsa closed her eyes. When next she spoke, her voice was weak, vulnerable. "I need it. I need to forget the memories, Markus, I keep remembering them _still_. Please. I need this to be free."

And it was then that Anna finally understood why Elsa did it. She wanted to repress the memories of her parents, of her abuse, of being weak, as if pushing them away she could pretend none of it ever happened. From that desire would be born the Elsa she knew, the one who isolated herself so far she separated herself from humanity.

"It's not worth it," Anna whispered, reaching with a shaking hand to hover over Elsa's cheek. "Elsa, I'm begging you. Don't do this to yourself, you're going to regret it–!"

Markus nodded, and with an uttered incantation, a dark knife appeared in his hand. He handed it to Elsa and looked away with a heavy sigh, as though lamenting.

Elsa took the knife and placed it over her heart. Anna was transfixed with horror, yearning to look away but transfixed, and she muttered under breath, over and over, "No, Elsa. No, no, no…"

"Thank you," Elsa said.

"_Stop it!_"

Elsa plunged the knife in.

* * *

She couldn't control it. To preserve Markus, her reliquary also claimed the entire Southern Isles in shared stasis, and the eternal winter raged on.

But she had to _pretend_ that she had control, _pretend_ that all was by her will.

An imperious figure, staring down with all the authority of the divine.

"From today on, I am Queen Elsa."

But her eyes held nothing, only a vast, wintry tempest, and to be divine was to be alone.

* * *

Anna awoke with a scream.

"Anna!"

Through the haze, Anna vaguely registered that someone was shaking her. Slowly, her eyes focused. Anna saw Elsa at her side and holding her close, face terrified. Queen Elsa. Not the frightened child or the desperate teenager, but Elsa the Snow Queen was actually crying as she held her.

"…Elsa?"

Elsa smiled, something in between a sob and a laugh escaping her lips as she brought Anna closer, hugging her tightly as though afraid she would suddenly disappear. "You're here. You're still here."

Anna hugged back, burrowing her face in Elsa's shoulder and breathing in the scent of ice. But there were words she had to say. Drawing on the last of her strength, Anna drew back.

"Why?" Anna asked quietly. Elsa stilled, and now Anna could see she truly no longer needed to breathe. She was as unmoving as stone, petrified and static. "Why would you do that to yourself, Elsa?"

"…You saw."

"Everything."

Anna laid a hand over her heart, and Elsa followed with her eyes. Little more needed to be explained between them. Anna realized that she could feel everything Elsa was feeling: the desperation for validation, the insecurity that had pushed her to the sacrifice of her heart; the need for affirmation, the fear that her choice had been wrong after all. It was a presence in the back of her mind. Or in the recesses of her heart. That would probably be more accurate.

"I needed to be free," Elsa murmured. "I needed to forget. And it worked, Anna. I made the reliquary and suddenly the world was clearer, I could temper my thoughts and control my emotions–"

"It's not control to shut your emotions out," Anna said. "You're just lying to yourself."

"What if I don't want to feel?" Elsa asked, but the turbulence of her gaze betrayed her. Just outside, the snowstorm grew stronger and stronger. "Being human means feeling pain. I don't want to be that weak child anymore. If that's the alternative, I'd rather be heartless."

"But you aren't happy."

Elsa said nothing, but Anna refused to let her avoid this. She kept eye-contact and remained silent, waiting for Elsa to answer. At length, Elsa shook her head. "It's too late. It's too late, Anna! What's done is done, I knew when I made my choice. I'll never be able to reverse it."

"Then why did you do it? Why wouldn't you give yourself a way out?" Anna asked. "There were other ways, Elsa. You could have been happy. You didn't have to–"

"If I had met you sooner," Elsa said. When her lips curled into a tiny, wry smile, Anna felt her heart bleed open. "Maybe if I had you before, then I wouldn't have had to resort to this."

"…But I'm here for you now," Anna said, and Elsa closed her eyes. "You're not broken, Elsa, you're _not_. You said it yourself. You can feel again."

"You heard that?"

"Am I wrong?"

Slowly, Elsa shook her head again. Outside, the storm raged on, wind sweeping ice and snow into an unstoppable flurry. Elsa was afraid. Was she really so scared of feeling again? No. She could see it in her eyes, feel it in her heart. Elsa wanted to, more than anything. So then, what…?

"Now that you know what I am, what I've done…" Elsa began, voice trembling, and Anna knew what she was going to ask before she even finished. "Are you afraid of me?"

Anna kept her eyes fixed unblinkingly on Elsa. Only inches away, they stared at each other in silence, and it felt like they were the last two people in the world. They were the only two people to matter.

"No," Anna said. "I'm not afraid."

With a roar like thunder, the storm calmed at last.
