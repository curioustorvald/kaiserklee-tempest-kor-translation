**Chapter 32: Gilded Cage**

Darkness.

"You left me behind with so many questions, so many riddles. I know you have the answers, Gustaf. So why don't you just tell me who I am?"

Edmund sat alone in the windowless room that once belonged to Gustaf, and in the dead of night, the only light that shined was a flickering candle held loosely in his grasp. An orange glow waxed and waned along the wall, constantly mired in battle with the shadows, gaining ground then forced to yield ground again. It was a losing battle, but watching the undulation of fire was comforting. At the very least, it occupied his attention. For a short while, at least, but that was enough.

"Why did you wait until after you died to tell me all this? What use is this now?"

Strange that he felt wetness on his face and tasted salt on his lips. Crying was so foreign, so surreal. Still, he didn't bother wiping away the tears and simply let them fall. It was a relief to cry. Tears were caught by the letter in his hand, and the ink smudged into incomprehensible blurs. It was fine. Already its contents were burned into his mind, and even the handwriting engraved in his memory.

"Let me tell you. It's no use at all, Gustaf. You've left me with regrets and impossible dreams."

Edmund lifted the letter and raised it to the flame, watching as the edge ignited and curled, as the paper glowed red-hot and the blackened edge crept upward. Watching the letter burn was comforting, too. Erasure was not so terrible after all. It burned away to a pile of ashes on the floor, and Edmund scooped them up into his hand.

"Goodbye, Father."

One gentle breath and the ashes scattered, but they hung in the air, suspended, for longer than Edmund was willing to wait. Pressing his finger into the flame, he filled the room with silent darkness and sat once more, waiting for his eyes to readjust to the empty space.

Day had long since turned to night by the time Anna returned to her room. She felt exhausted, her body weary and her mind even more so. It made the walk back torturously long, the staircase dauntingly tall, and where once she could have bounded up skipping steps as she went, she instead trudged her way back with a burdened, wizened walk. Anna didn't feel cold anymore, not with the reliquary embedded in her heart, but she shivered anyway as she walked alone through the halls. Not a soul to be seen. What was once familiar now felt horribly foreign. It was even worse than when she first arrived, now that she understood the depravity of this royal family that would not spare even its own.

Anna missed home.

She missed the simplicity of life in Arendelle. Here, she was surrounded by intrigue and death, without even a moment to rest. She missed the sight of blue skies and white clouds. Here, she looked up to a blank canvas bereft of color. She missed the warmth of the sun. Here, she was inundated with the cold, and only the cold. Arendelle was like a dream from the distant past. Or, maybe, the Southern Isles was a nightmare within which she found herself trapped.

Even the familiarity of her shared quarters with Elsa did nothing to soothe her doubts. It was exhausting. Without exception, all of this was exhausting.

Anna swung the door open.

Elsa was waiting for her. As soon as Anna opened the door, Elsa stood from her seat at the desk and edged forward, looking painfully unsure.

"It's late," Elsa murmured. "Where were you?"

"With Edmund," Anna said. It was explanation enough. Both of them knew the toll that recent events had placed on the prince, and everything she had learned today, Anna would not tell Elsa. Edmund had requested her silence, and she agreed. It was his own private matter.

But even if Edmund hadn't wanted her to, Anna would have stayed silent. It would just exacerbate the growing tension between her and Elsa. She didn't have the strength for another debate about Markus.

"Of course." Elsa shifted while Anna hung up her cloak. When she finished, Elsa gestured towards a covered tray on the desk. "You didn't show up for supper, so I had this saved for you."

"Thanks." Anna uncovered the tray to reveal a full meal with all of her favorites: kjøttkaker, krumkake, completed by a plate of chocolates. It usually cheered her to see the familiar Arendellian foods. It only brought another pang of homesickness now, like a physical blow that knocked the air from her chest.

"Is something wrong?" Anna hadn't realized she was staring at the food. She broke out of her trance only when Elsa tentatively laid her hand on her shoulder.

"N-Nothing! I just…I just…" Anna sat down and took up the utensils, slicing into the beef with stiff, mechanical motions. She couldn't even lift it to her mouth. She sat there with her head down, appetite failing her now that her weariness caught up. "Sorry, I'm overthinking. It's nothing. You should get some sleep, I know you have to be tired and you still waited up for me and I don't even–"

"Anna, I don't need to sleep."

She heard the sound of shifting cloth and the creak of wood, and then a long finger under her chin tilted her head up. Anna blinked at the odd sight of Elsa sitting atop her table, half-bent over and looking so uncharacteristically informal with her hair down that she had a hard time processing. Elsa looked less like the regal queen she was and more like the younger incarnation Anna had seen in her memories. More than once, Anna had witnessed the strange dichotomy, and she wondered. Was Elsa just comfortable enough around her to be like this, or did she put on this appearance solely for her sake?

"We talked about this," Anna said, shoving the intrusive thought aside. She slid back in her chair so her chin pulled away from Elsa. "You don't _need_ to, but you still get tired so you can still recharge."

"I won't sleep while something is bothering you," Elsa said.

"It's nothing–"

"Anything that bothers you is not nothing. We talked about this as well," Elsa murmured. "You can tell me anything. When did we start holding back our thoughts from one another?"

"I-I don't know," Anna said. She shook her head. "I'm sorry–"

"I don't want you to be sorry." Elsa hopped off the table and extended her hand; Anna took it, slightly bewildered, and was led to sit on the bed. Elsa sat down across from her, still holding her hand. "I want you to tell me what's wrong, so that we can fix all this."

Anna sighed. "I'm just tired. I don't know how you manage after all this craziness. Aren't you tired too?"

"I can manage. I have you." Elsa brushed her hair back and managed a weak smile, but Anna could see she was just as tired. "But there's more, isn't there?"

"Everything here has been..." Anna closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "I'm not cut out for this. So much has happened. So many people have died. And what happened to Hans, and Edmund...I keep thinking all this was because of me. It only started after I came here."

"It's not your fault. If anything, the Sorcerer must have held a grudge against me." Elsa sighed. "But I don't pretend to understand Gustaf; I'm still trying to make sense of all this. It doesn't seem _to_ make sense. I'm still tense, even more than when we were actually trying to capture the Sorcerer. I still can't believe that we did. Or that he was Gustaf. I always feel…uneasy…as if my vision were blinded."

"Is everything…all right?"

"They will be. Some time may help. Time…" Elsa forced another smile, but it fell as quickly as it came. Anna noticed now, the deep-set exhaustion in her eyes, the old calm stretched taut like frayed wire about to snap. "But what about you, Anna?"

"…I miss Arendelle," Anna said.

"Yes, I thought you might." Elsa paused. And then she blurted, "If there's anything I can do, I will. If the food isn't enough, I can find something else. Music. Art. Or I could find some other keepsake–"

None of that was Arendelle. It wasn't anything _from_ home that she missed. It was the _concept_ of home, of safety, familiarity. On impulse, Anna asked, "Could I maybe…visit home? Just for a short while?"

Immediately, Elsa stiffened. She could try to mask the reflex all she wanted, but Anna saw the sharp intake of breath, the recoil, and she felt the slightly tightening grip around her hands. Strangest of all, though, was the widening of her eyes. With fear, Anna realized, though she did not understand why. It was maybe the most foreign emotion she had ever seen from Elsa.

"I see. Perhaps later, I can arrange for that," Elsa said simply.

Anna could recognize a dismissal when she heard one. Elsa didn't want to talk anymore, and that would have been the end of the conversation, except – Elsa had taken the first step. Now she was withdrawing into herself again, but Anna realized how much courage it must have taken, courage that she herself had lately been reluctant to demonstrate. Enough was enough. She had to at least try to make things better, just as Elsa was trying now. It wasn't fair that she left everything on her shoulders.

"Hey, "Anna said, and Elsa tilted her head. "Let's talk about something else."

"…Of course."

They had yet to fulfill their promise to talk, truly talk, like they said they would just before confronting the Sorcerer. It _had_ been on Anna's mind, but now seemed a good time to distract Elsa from her paranoia as well. "So I think it's about time we discussed…lately. And before you say anything, yeah, I _am_ sorry," Anna said. "After all this craziness, I just missed home and I…I haven't been all here for you."

"I don't blame you. I _can't_ blame you," Elsa corrected, shaking her head. "You say you haven't been there for me, but I wasn't for you either. You and I both know. I used you, Anna. And maybe that's something that can't be forgiven."

Maybe. Or maybe not. Anna could find it in herself to forgive, and maybe she had already done so, but it wasn't something she would forget soon. From the time Elsa returned from Weselton, for an entire week and more, Anna had been caught in between her and the Sorcerer. Without pause, the two had waged war on her mind. Even without perfect control, Elsa could send thoughts and feelings through the link of her reliquary easily enough, and the constant stream of directives from both mages had at times overwhelmed Anna's own thoughts entirely.

Elsa had been manipulating her thoughts. She had _wanted_ her to feel the need to revisit the reliquary.

All so that the Sorcerer would have a subconscious desire to act on, and fall into her trap.

"It wasn't fun," Anna said. She exhaled and squared her shoulders, trying to draw strength that she didn't have. "But I get why you did what you did. It had to be me."

Elsa bowed her head. "It was cruel of me. But I…I hoped that you would understand. You always have. And you did, or else this plan wouldn't have succeeded."

Somewhere buried deep below her conscious mind, Anna _had_ understood what Elsa was trying to accomplish. Not clearly. It was only a vague thought in the back of her head, an intuitive feeling brought about by the shard in her heart. But Anna's minimal comprehension was still enough to break the Sorcerer's hold once the reliquary brought it to the surface, and now that the ordeal was over, Anna could see the need for Elsa's callous strategy.

At least, she held onto that thought for comfort.

It didn't sting any less, but the wound would heal, and she could forgive with time.

"Just…never do it again," Anna said, and Elsa nodded. "From now on, I need you to always be honest with me. There's one more thing I want to ask you."

Maybe her somber tone had alarmed Elsa. She straightened, sitting with her back rigid and head held high. It seemed almost like a reflex. "All right," Elsa said.

"I want to know how much was real," Anna said. "I mean, out of everything you said and did that week. How much was for the Sorcerer's sake? How much was an act?"

It was a simple enough question. Or so Anna had thought. Instead of replying immediately, Elsa pressed her lips together and seemed to consider for a moment. "Can you…not tell?"

"I want to hear it from you."

"I said and did lots of things that week. What part do you mean?" Elsa asked. She closed her eyes, and shook her head with a dry laugh. "Because I meant it when I told you I missed you, I meant it when I told you I didn't want to lose you. Please don't doubt that."

Anna widened her eyes. "That's not – I didn't mean that. Sorry, I-I know you meant that. It was just, I'm just saying…about the rest…"

"It's not important." Elsa wrapped her arms around herself, shoulders just barely hunched. "All the rest doesn't matter anymore."

"You said you would answer my question," Anna insisted. Elsa was beginning to sound…different. She sounded cold, like the arctic chill of her powers had somehow infused itself into her voice. "It's about–"

"I already answered."

Anna frowned. "But that's not what I meant. What about when you said that you don't care about the people? Just, everything you said to make me think that you were becoming like the Sor–"

"It was all an act," Elsa said. "Just an act, I promise."

Elsa had answered her too quickly. She had stiffened immediately at the question, and when they looked at each other, some strange emotion had flickered in her eyes before she looked away again.

"Are you…sure?" Anna asked, against her better instinct telling her to stop. She couldn't leave this issue beneath the surface again. Not when she had the budding suspicion that Elsa was…

"Yes, Anna. Just an act." Elsa pulled her hands away and folded them in her lap, trying to appear unaffected, but her movements were jerky, and her fingernails dug into the fabric of her dress. When she spoke again, her tone harshened. Bitter. Sharp. Dismissive. "I wouldn't say so otherwise."

…lying. Elsa was lying. It didn't take the angry pulse from the reliquary to tell her that.

"All right. I'm going to ask one more time." Anna exhaled a slow breath. Elsa had deliberately changed the subject before, and then lied, but she would give her one more chance. Just once more. She had to have a reason. "Please tell me the–"

"Why do you keep asking? Do you want me to say something else?" Elsa clenched her jaw and looked out to the rest of the room, gaze focusing on the door. "It's true, Anna. And that's the last I'll speak of it."

It was always like this.

"So if that's true…" Anna paused for a moment to breathe, feeling betrayal kindle at the base of her stomach. "Why won't you look me in the eyes when you answer? I am _sick_ of always guessing–!"

Elsa flung out her hand and seized the bedpost, and immediately ice exploded across the column in jagged points. Staring at her from under the shadow of loosened hair, Elsa no longer appeared more relaxed, but all the wilder when her eyes shined bright blue. It was an inhuman glow. Frenzied and feverish, like a cornered animal, wounded but all the more dangerous for its desperation. Elsa even pulled her lips back into a snarl, fingers of her free hand curled into claws around her chest.

"I'm looking you in the eyes now," Elsa said, practically shaking. "And I'm telling you that it was all just an act. Are you happy?"

"No," Anna said. If Elsa was going to lose her temper for no reason, she could be angry too. "Just a minute ago you agreed to be honest with me, and now you're lying! What are you so afraid of–!"

"_What does it matter what I think of other people?_" Elsa clenched the bedpost and a shockwave erupted outward, strong enough to reach both sides of the room. Ice sliced clean through the left wall. Everything on her table was scattered and the right-side windows burst, allowing an icy gale to sweep in.

She had never heard Elsa scream before. Elsa had always been too restrained to have such an outburst, and Anna had become used to deciphering her tiniest motions to figure out her thoughts. Hearing her scream, seeing her doubled over and heaving shaky breaths, Anna was completely lost. She froze. And then she realized – _Elsa was crying_. She made no sound but the teardrops were wetting her dress, even the bed. Elsa released the bedpost and pulled her hair back, clutching her head in her hands, and when one tiny, barely audible sob escaped her lips, Anna finally realized she was doing nothing.

Anna pulled Elsa into her arms and held on as tight as she could.

Elsa hugged her back as though she were a lifeline.

"What's wrong?" Anna asked. She was terrified. She had never been more terrified as seeing Elsa break down like this, not even when she had come face to face with the Sorcerer while surrounded by blood and death. Anna was close to crying herself, and all she could do was rub circles into Elsa's back as she hated how helpless she was. "Please, Elsa. Please, tell me what's wrong. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry–"

"I-I don't want – I don't want – I don't want to be like him." Elsa held on tighter, and Anna could feel her trembling, as violently as if she had no control over her body. Anna wasn't so sure that wasn't the case.

"You don't want to be like–"

"Gustaf warned me," Elsa blurted. "Gustaf told me this would happen. I don't eat, I don't breathe, I don't sleep. I'm not – I'm not even alive anymore, I can't – I can't feel anything. I can feel myself slipping away! I don't want to be like the Sorcerer, Anna, I don't want to forget, I don't want to be no one–!"

"It won't happen," Anna said. "I won't let that happen."

It felt like the wrong thing to say once it left her mouth, and Anna didn't understand why. But Elsa needed her now. Elsa was holding on even tighter than before, so Anna let go of her fear. When Elsa buried into her shoulder, Anna brushed through her hair and pressed her lips to the top of her head.

"Everything's going to be fine," Anna murmured. "I'm sorry I pushed, I just don't know what to think. Please just tell me what's wrong."

"It's true. I don't care about the rest of them. I don't even care about myself. Not anymore." Elsa took in a deep, rattling breath and exhaled out, once, and then again. "I feel nothing for the world, I don't understand people, and I don't want to. I don't care. But the rest of the week, the other things, _you_–! Please. Please don't doubt that. What I feel for you. Everything I've said to you – I mean all of it."

Oh.

"You ground me," Elsa said. She pulled away, though she kept a tight grip on Anna's shoulders to steady herself. Even her eyes were dilated, and widened so far the whites were visible all around the iris. "I'm empty inside, except for you. I know you care, so I wanted to – I wanted to be like you. I didn't want to disappoint you. So I…lied. Do you…see…why, now?"

"That's not…" Anna swallowed. "You don't have to do or say anything because that's what I want."

"Now _you're_ lying. Everyone wants something. Except me." Elsa swung off the side of the bed, pacing the room with spastic movements. "Except now…I found you. I don't – I don't know anymore. I'm sorry. I'm not making any sense. I can't make any sense of all this myself, and I just…I don't know."

Elsa stilled and sunk to the floor, sitting at the exact center of the snowflake pattern embossed in the carpet. Anna approached carefully, but Elsa didn't even seem to notice anything anymore. She had her face hidden behind drawn-in knees. Even when Anna sat down next to her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder, Elsa didn't react.

"I didn't realize how much pressure I was putting on you," Anna said.

Elsa laughed. "So how much of what you said did _you_ mean, when you called me heartless?"

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

"How can you be sorry when that was my fault? I was _trying_ to push you away. I should have been happy to hear that. But secretly, I hoped…I hoped I would fail," Elsa said. She raised her head. Her eyes had calmed, the feverish light had dimmed, and even her tears had dried, but her flawless composure was no comfort. "It was only the truth. I _am_ heartless."

No; Anna would not, could not accept this. She could not let Elsa shut down, could not let her go down the same route as the Sorcerer.

"Elsa, I'm not always right. I'm probably wrong half the time, I screw up more often than I do things right," Anna said. "It can be my fault too. You don't have to blame yourself for everything."

"You still don't understand. I'm not like you. I'm…flawed," Elsa breathed. "And I'm trying so hard to learn from you, but once I think I've started to, I realize – I haven't changed. I'm still heartless."

"Then I can be your heart."

"…What?" Elsa turned with reluctant hope on her face, and she looked so broken. Beautiful, but broken, like shattered pieces of porcelain held together by will and prayer. It was all beginning to crumble.

"I can be your heart," Anna said again. Once more, the crawling feeling of apprehension returned. Saying that felt as wrong as it did right, and her blood seemed to turn to ice in her veins, her stomach plummeted as though she had leapt into an abyss, even as her heart soared with song. She'd never felt anything so strongly. She'd never been so righteous and driven and sick all at once. Maybe it was too much responsibility, but Elsa was hopeful again, and Anna had never wanted anything more.

"Anna…"

"I'm serious. You don't have to be alone, I can be here for you. We can face this together," Anna pleaded. "Just please, you have to let me help."

"…What about Arendelle?" Elsa smiled sadly.

It almost seemed unrelated, except for one thing.

"You don't want me to go," Anna realized. "You're afraid of something."

"Because this castle of ice is just a glorified gilded cage. I'm afraid that once you taste freedom again, you won't come back," Elsa said. "I know I said once that I would let you leave if you wished, but – I'm only afraid of one thing in the world, Anna. I'm afraid that you'll leave me."

"I-It's not like that. I miss home, but–"

"I'm your cage."

Anna quieted. Elsa's face hardened, her lips tightened, her hands clenched in the agony of her doubts. But then her eyes softened. It was always her eyes that spoke the loudest.

"You're not my cage. If you're hurt, then I'll support you. If you're in pain, then I'll bear your pain! I _want_ to be here with you. It's my choice," Anna said. "And you can't make it for me."

"And how will you bear the pain?" Elsa asked. "Can you tell me that you've always been happy here?"

"No," Anna answered, and Elsa smiled. But Anna wasn't done. She rose to her feet and dragged Elsa up with all her strength, stumbling backwards until Elsa steadied them both. "It's not always going to be happy. I can accept that. It _shouldn't_ always be perfect. I don't _want_ it to always be perfect, I want to be here, with you, for the good and the bad!"

"Anna…"

"Don't say anything." Anna smiled. "We can go to Arendelle together, just the two of us. So I can show you that part of myself."

"Why would you want me to go with you?"

"You shouldn't have to ask," Anna said. "I'll always want you to be with me."

"But…why?" Elsa asked. She drew away and straightened, and now she was herself. She was composed, but not unnaturally. She wasn't forcefully blocking everything out. No, Elsa was letting herself _be_ herself, even though that someone was a confused, lost soul. And that was a step. Anna couldn't be more proud. "Anna, I don't understand. Why would you go this far for…me?"

"Because I love you."

Anna leaned forward and kissed Elsa.

And this time felt right.
