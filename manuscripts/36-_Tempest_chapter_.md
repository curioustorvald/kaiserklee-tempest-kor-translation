**Chapter 36: A Dream That Must End**

It'd been so long since she last felt cold that, for a moment, Anna couldn't name the sensation.

Most people became accustomed enough to the feeling of cold that the individual aspects of _being_ cold were lost on them; Anna had certainly never before taken time to analyze what it meant to be cold, but after such a long time of feeling comfortable while inundated by winter chill, her sudden susceptibility made all the symptoms startlingly clear. Anna felt almost like she was discovering a new sense. It was like her body was falling asleep. Being touched by cold felt a little like being pinched, a hurt that was strange, not painful enough to elicit a cry but enough to make her flinch away.

"Are you sure you're all right?" Elsa asked.

"It's sorta weird feeling cold," Anna admitted. "But I'm all right! It's not like being a bit cold will kill me. Besides, the weather here is normal. I'm warming up!"

Having moved away from the snow plain Elsa had created around her old home, Anna was feeling much more revived. With the warmth of the sun on her skin, the goosebumps on her arm had gone away and the feeling of drowsiness faded back into awareness. Now she only wondered why the sudden change had taken place. One moment she felt at ease in the cold, and the next she became so aware of it.

And something just seemed missing now.

Anna couldn't name exactly what, but there was an unfamiliar quiet where once existed more. It was rather like waking up and forgetting a vivid dream that, only moments prior, she could recall with perfect clarity. She said nothing about it to avoid worrying Elsa further, but Anna herself didn't feel anything wrong per se. Different, but not even a bad different.

"As long as you're sure that you're fine," Elsa said.

"Really," Anna said, but her trademark smile didn't seem to reassure Elsa. She was still frowning and, Anna thought, looking put out in a rather adorable sort of way. It wasn't every day she got to see Elsa with cheeks puffed out. "You're more worried than me!"

"It's just…" Elsa trailed off and walked faster without any warning, blurting out her next words while she was ahead so Anna couldn't see her face. "If the cold bothers you now, then do I also…?"

Anna pulled on Elsa's arm and spun her around, pulling her closer in one smooth motion so that their faces were only inches apart. She laughed at how befuddled Elsa looked with her eyebrows screwed together and mouth ajar. It was hard _not_ to kiss her, and Anna gave in to the impulse, pressing her lips against the blonde's jaw while still muffling her laughter.

"We're obviously fine," Anna said.

"Well," Elsa breathed, "I'm glad."

Save for the night of their arrival, they had acted like ordinary friends – or as ordinary as they could be, given the circumstance of their meeting – for the entire duration of their time in Arendelle. Once she kissed her, Anna had the vague realization this was the only time she had really been at all intimate with Elsa. And she had _missed_ this, so much. Elsa likely had the same thought. She bent down and gave Anna a soft kiss, one that was not urgent but had no lack of intensity, one meant to draw out their time and enjoy her presence. Anna deepened the kiss, lips parting to give Elsa entrance while she pulled the queen closer. It all ended too soon. Elsa pulled away long before Anna was willing to let go.

"We'll have as much time as we want once we get back," Elsa said.

"Oh. Yeah. I almost forgot about that, but today's the last day, huh?" On the hill where they stood, they were on high enough ground that nearly all of Arendelle was visible. Anna could trace the path she had taken from the castle to the docks on the day she left for the Southern Isles.

Elsa searched her face, and try as Anna might to keep her expression natural, she knew Elsa was much too familiar with her smile to not notice this one was forced. "You don't have to pretend, Anna. I understand you'll miss home."

"It's not…I mean, I will, but I don't feel bad about leaving," Anna said. "I want to be where you are. Besides, we'll come back, right?"

"...Yes. If that's what you want," Elsa said. She gestured toward the path back to the town proper, where already the bustle was dying down. Night was fast falling, and before long, even the candlelight would be extinguished. "Let's head back."

It was a short walk, but it still gave Anna time to think. She drew her cloak closer to fight off the night chill, wondering if she ought to tell her father about her relationship with Elsa. It had been easy to think telling him before she left was a better alternative to telling him at the beginning, but ending their brief reunion on a bad note now seemed just as undesirable. Maybe this was why secrets were so often hidden, Anna thought. It wasn't that people _wanted_ to keep secrets. It was hard to find the right time to divulge them. Or, really, it was hard to find the courage.

Before she knew it, they had passed through town and the castle gates loomed over her head. Guards were posted at the entrance, which wasn't an unusual occurrence. What _did_ seem strange was their number; Arendelle Castle had never needed many guards, and the few they employed were there mostly for appearances. Now Anna looked up and saw armored sentries patrolling the walls, bearing longbows and grim expressions.

Once they'd gone through the gates, Elsa murmured, "Don't they seem tense?"

"Maybe there's a training exercise going on," Anna said.

Elsa didn't reply, but nothing else seemed out of the ordinary. When they pushed open the doors they were greeted by Gerda, who greeted Elsa with her usual half-nervous, half-unpracticed curtsey and Anna with much more enthusiasm.

"Dinner should be ready soon," Gerda said, eyeing Anna's outfit with disapproval. "We'll go get you ready, dear. As for Queen Elsa…"

Anna rolled her eyes when Elsa pulled off her cloak and handed it to Gerda without a second thought, waving her hand over her dress so that ice melded over the fabric and formed her usual attire. "Go ahead, Anna," Elsa said.

"Right, way to be flashy," Anna grumbled. She struggled to wrench her cloak off, scattering her hair in a hundred directions while Elsa looked immaculate as always. "I'll be right back! Meet you in the dining room."

She followed Gerda up the stairs, her rotund caretaker ascending with more haste than was her norm; Anna skipped steps and kept up easily, but Gerda usually took her time with the stairs owing to rheumatic pain in her back. Once they reached the second floor, Gerda walked behind her, hurrying her along, and Anna obeyed with some bemusement.

"What's the rush?" Anna asked. "Please don't tell me Pappa has some sort of surprise planned. I mean, _I'm_ fine with surprises, but sometimes Elsa has this paranoid thing–"

"It'll be fine," Gerda said, pushing open the door to her room, and gesturing with wide waves of her arm for Anna to enter.

"No, really. She overreacts, I thought that poor duckling was going to get it-"

Once Anna stepped across the threshold to her room, Gerda slammed the door shut.

She whirled around, but the protest on her tongue gave way to dread when she heard the lock turn. Anna reached out for the knob, slowly, and gave it a tentative twist. When it didn't budge, her motions became more frantic. Anna turned the knob again and again, began to shake the thing until it rattled, and even banged on the door with her free hand, but it never opened.

"Gerda!" Anna shouted. She could still hear the woman's breathing on the other side, but she didn't say anything. "Gerda! What's going on? Let me out!"

"It's for the best, Anna! You'll be safe in your room until this all blows over–"

"Until _what_ blows over?" Anna demanded, but from the moment Gerda locked her inside, she had known. It was a dread that settled at the base of her stomach, a dryness in her mouth. Panic curled around her heart when she heard footstep leaving. "Hey! Gerda! Listen to me!"

But she was alone and she knew it. Anna banged on the door one last, futile time, but her strength had left her and she made no sound that would even penetrate the wooden surface. Anna slid down to her knees, breaths harshening. She had to get out of here. She had to get back to Elsa.

She cast her gaze around her room, searching for anything that might help her escape. If only she'd learned how to pick locks! Now she regretted never asking Alek to teach her. Nothing she could carry would be enough to barge down the door. Anna slammed her shoulder against the door, again and again, feeling her flesh bruise but never faltering until, finally, the pain forced her to stop. Nothing. If that exit wouldn't work, then-

Anna spun around towards her windows, but one glance at them and her hope died. While she was out, her windows had been boarded with steel plates nailed down to the wall, leaving only thin slits of the clear pane for the barest of light to filter through. It wasn't a big enough gap for Anna to climb through. Even if she had the proper tools to pry the plates off, she doubted she had the strength.

She was trapped within four corners with no way out.

* * *

Elsa seated herself across from Agdar at the dinner table.

It was ritual for them to sit like this, but without Anna's presence, their positioning struck Elsa as confrontational. Much the same as their encounter during her siege of Arendelle, Elsa had taken Agdar's seat, the one at the front of the table, while he had been relegated to the other end. It was trapping, in a way. Neither of them could look at much else than each other. Elsa could redirect her gaze towards the door on the wall behind Agdar, but that would appear too weak.

"Today will be the last day I require your hospitality," Elsa said.

"Yes," Agdar agreed. Adjusting his collar and pulling it forward as though he weren't getting enough air, he looked more flustered than Elsa had seen him yet. Although he had never grown comfortable in her presence, he had certainly still been poised. "I hope you enjoyed your time in Arendelle, Queen Elsa."

"It was...enlightening."

She _had_ learned much from this excursion. Not just the trolls and where the Mirror piece was hidden, but about herself. Visiting her old home had turned out to be more beneficial than she could have ever expected. Elsa could feel the difference in her power. It had always raged beneath her skin before, always been repressed under explosive pressure that threatened to erupt at any moment and destroy everything in her path. Now her magic had calmed. It was like a current running through her veins, all blockage excised to leave the best of herself.

"I'm glad," Agdar said, and he cleared his throat as though to continue. His verbosity surprised her. It was possible that this was the longest conversation they had ever shared. "I've spoken to Anna, and I wish to thank you for taking good care of her."

"...Of course. Anna is just as important to me as she is to you," Elsa said.

"You don't understand. Anna...I worried for her. Ever since her mother died, I've done everything I could to protect her. But I couldn't stop her from sacrificing herself." Agdar looked down at his hands, eyes closing as though the weight of his responsibility forced them shut.

"I've told you that you underestimate her."

"Yes. I recognize that now." Agdar opened his eyes. "I was wrong to think she was a sacrifice. Anna made a choice. She's much stronger than I was willing to admit."

"In that case, you'll have no problem with me taking her back with me," Elsa said. "I don't offer assurances, but just this once, because you are her father - Anna will be safe."

"...Indeed." Agdar smiled and gestured to the lavish meal. "While we wait for Anna, feel free to eat. We aren't as bound to formality as you might expect."

"From what I've seen of Anna, I never expected that." It took every ounce of effort to repress a smile, but she did still have to maintain appearances in front of Agdar. Elsa shook her head. "But I can wait. Go ahead if that's what you wish."

"Perhaps something to drink?"

"Water will be fine."

Elsa might not have accepted, except Arendelle Castle held more braziers and furnaces than was comfortable, and the hot, dry air parched her throat. At her request, Agdar picked up the pitcher and reached across the table to fill her glass; Elsa inclined her head in thanks and lifted the drink to her lips. Over the rim of the glass, she saw Agdar watching her every move. Doubtless he was still suspicious of her intentions. Before Elsa drank, she lowered the glass to the table.

"If you're worried about Anna, there's really no need," Elsa said. "I wish only the best for her. If there is anything I might say or do to assuage your concerns…"

"Excuse my bluntness, but no, I don't there exists any such comfort," Agdar said, lips turning into a tight smile that creased the lines of his mouth. "It's difficult for a parent not to worry."

Elsa frowned. "Isn't that contradictory to what you just said about her being strong?"

"If we're to speak of contradictions, Queen Elsa, I think you know more than anyone," Agdar said. Though he raised his glass in toast, his smile fell. "If you did wish the best for Anna, you should know that being here, in her home and with her family, is what's best. Not being forced to leave her life."

Elsa gripped the base of her glass. "I'm not forcing her to do anything."

Agdar offered no comment. Elsa lifted her drink again and threw it back, letting the cold water soothe the sting of his words. When she placed the glass down, Agdar stood from his seat and refilled it without prompting. Elsa glared across the table, but Agdar, after reseating himself, kept silent.

"Well?" Elsa demanded.

"If that's what you believe," Agdar said.

"You have no idea how little you know." Elsa looked away, trying to control her anger. She had no need to endear herself to the man, but he was still Anna's father. Anyone else would have been silenced already, but she could afford him some leeway. "It doesn't matter. We'll be gone tomorrow."

Elsa took another drink, wondering why it was taking so long for Anna to arrive.

"Tomorrow. Yes." Agdar rose and paced the length of the dining room, the heels of his boots clicking against the polished floor with a distinctive, paced rhythm. "All of this will be over by tomorrow."

"You don't seem sad to see her go."

"I won't need to."

Elsa watched him, confused; Agdar's figure was blurring before her eyes. And then she realized it wasn't him. All the room began to spin, as though earth and sky had been reversed, and when she tried to stand, her legs buckled. She stumbled, hand slamming onto the edge of the table to keep balance, and all the plates rattled with the force of her fall.

"How…?" Elsa shook her head, but her vision only blurred further. It should be impossible to poison her, not while her magic constantly repaired the damage. Even the medications for her headaches were at a dosage strong enough to kill a score of men.

"I'm sorry, Elsa," Agdar said. It was infuriating that he had the gall to sound genuinely regretful. Elsa wished nothing more than to fly across the room and strangle him. "I wish it didn't have to be this way."

"If you think this is enough, you are sorely mistaken," Elsa said, biting out her words even as her body shook with both pain and fury. "If poison could kill me, I would have died a thousand times by now."

"Of course. I am well aware."

At the sound of marching footsteps, Elsa whipped her head towards the doors. Soldiers poured into the dining room from both entrances, but rather than swords or spears, they carried in their hands burlap sacks. Elsa couldn't find the strength to move her leaden limbs while they overturned the bags and scattered white crystals through the room. It didn't take long to realize what they were. Elsa could smell the sea salt like an acrid burn.

"…Clever," Elsa muttered. It would be hard enough to utilize magic while her senses were muddled, but with the salt countering her efforts, attempts at ice magic would likely be futile. Salt even served as protection against her lightning, since it didn't conduct electricity. It was perfect. Too perfect. "And not something you could have come up with on your own, I think. How long have you been planning this?"

"Anna told me about your weaknesses long before you arrived," Agdar said.

Elsa tightened her grip on the table until the wood creaked under the pressure and her fingers felt like they would break. "You're lying. Anna would never–"

"Anna's loyalties have always been with her home." Agdar scrutinized her face, his own features drawn together with confusion. "Elsa. I acknowledge that you do, for whatever reason, care for Anna. But for your crimes against the kingdom of Arendelle and countless others, I sentence you to death."

Thirty soldiers crowded into the dining room, each one outfitted in steel plate armor from head to toe, equipped with sword or spear. And there she stood alone, unarmed, poisoned, limited in the use of her magic. Elsa threw back her head and laughed. Every movement sent a fresh spasm of pain wracking through her body, but she laughed and laughed until the sound reverberated through the room.

"You really think I'm helpless without magic." Elsa looked from one soldier to the next, noting the too-tight grips on their weapons and the deep breathing that almost rattled their armor. Trepidation bled from their every move. From behind his soldiers, Agdar stared unblinkingly with his confidence shaken.

"Don't make this harder for yourself," Agdar said.

"Worry about yourself."

Elsa ducked under the table just as a spear shot past where her head had been, and pushed off the ground on her fingertips to speed towards the first line of soldiers. Only one of them reacted in time and swung his sword down for her neck; Elsa evaded the blade and trapped his arm between her own. With one twist, she snapped it at the elbow and, ignoring his muffled scream, stole the blade in his hand.

Elsa cut across his neck and moved on to the next target before his body even began to fall.

As she moved, ice crept down the length of the sword and remolded it into a more preferable shape. What used to be a broadsword was pared down into a thinner longsword, the hilt curving into a more intricate, winged design. Elsa sidestepped a spear lunge and swung upwards to slice through the shaft, and snatched up the bladed tip to fling it through another soldier's breastplate.

Elsa had been trained to fight against groups. She knew to keep moving, to stay aware of her enemies, to position herself where she would not be trapped; but she always had use of her magic before. Elsa thrust her sword into the gaps of a chair's seatback, slinging it towards the crowd for some breathing space. It didn't last long. Only a second passed before they were on her again.

She didn't have time for them. She needed to get to Anna.

Snarl ripping from her throat, Elsa shoved against the crowd of soldiers and pushed through. Swinging her sword in wide, sweeping slashes, she tried to clear a path to the doors. It was inefficient. It was stupid. She _knew_ that, but just when she began to hope the element of surprise would bear her through, two broadswords crashed down. Elsa blocked both blows at once, and only the strength of her ice kept her sword intact. Her entire arm shook from the impact, vibrations rippling up to her shoulder and even jarring her skull. Physical strength wasn't her forte. Elsa flung herself away, throwing all her weight back and sliding her blade out from under the broadswords.

She stumbled.

All at once, the tide turned. She still managed to weave through the soldiers' ranks, still dodged every attack, but the poison's toll became more apparent with every step. Her reflexes were dulled, and her blurring vision nearly proved fatal when she narrowly avoided a sword aimed at her blind-spot. Sensing her weakness, the soldiers found their rhythm at last and concentrated their efforts, utilizing the heightened range of their spears to keep her at bay and off-balance. Elsa leapt backwards and lurched away from the multitude of spear strikes aimed for her feet.

"Please, Elsa. Just surrender."

"Save your kind words," Elsa hissed. While the spearmen occupied her attention, the rest of the soldiers had formed a ring around her. She was cornered against the back wall. "You want me dead, and you expect me to surrender?"

"It's not too late," Agdar said.

"Oh?" Despite Agdar's words, his men were already readying their bows, arrows nocked and bowstrings drawn tight. Elsa backed up to keep them all in view, but unless she pressed herself against the wall, that was an impossible task. Not even the smallest gap existed in their line either, no avenue of escape.

"If you surrender, I can spare your life," Agdar continued. "You would only be imprisoned. We would need to neutralize your magic somehow, but–"

"How do you intend to do that? Will you cut off my hands?" Elsa laughed when Agdar's mouth snapped shut. "It's not that easy. Magic doesn't come from the hands, Agdar, but from…"

Elsa paused. She had almost pointed to her chest, her heart.

"Elsa, I will only tell you once more. Surrender, and you will not be killed. All you must do is relinquish your sorcery."

"I would see everyone here dead before that happens," Elsa snarled. Always the same. Always her magic was seen as something to be reviled, something wicked. She looked from one soldier to the next, and even through their visors she could see the hate in their eyes. But fear, also, and they were right to fear. She was _better_ than them. "You are all weak, disgusting _cowards_, and I've killed enough of you to know that you are worth nothing, and I will raze this place to the ground until nothing is left–"

She saw a glint of iron out the corner of her eye, and twisted out of the way.

"Hold your fire!" Agdar shouted. When the last echoes of his command faded, the room fell silent.

Elsa turned back to see an arrow embedded into the wall, and for a moment she believed it had passed harmlessly; and then she saw its tip had been drenched with crimson. She looked down and saw the torn material of her dress, the deep gash torn into her side. It was such a foreign sensation. When she pressed her hand to the wound and saw blood spill onto her fingers, she felt the pain at last. But it was a good pain. She was still alive. All at once her blurring vision cleared, her senses flared to life, and the pain that lanced through her side reminded her just what it meant to _be_ Queen Elsa.

Elsa dashed forward and slammed her palm against one soldier's chest.

Ice skewered through his body, punching through armor, skin, and flesh to emerge out the other side. It was as visceral as if she had done it herself, driven her own hands through his chest and flayed it open. A gargled scream escaped his lips and his blood splattered the right side of her face; Elsa barely gave pause and flung his body towards another man, the icicle still embedded in his body, and impaled both of them upon the same spike. She could feel thick blood drip down her fingers just as it slid off her ice.

Panicked shouts came from all sides as the soldiers scattered. One fell in the chaos. She approached. When he scrambled to his feet and swung at her in a desperate attack, Elsa seized his wrist with her offhand. Before he could react, she brought her own blade down onto his undefended shoulder. The razor edge of her ice-sharpened sword slipped in between the shoulder guard and the neck-guard of her enemy's armor, sinking through chainmail and severing the arm cleanly at the joint.

She paid him no heed when the soldier reeled back, torso spraying blood from severed arteries, screaming in pain and shock. Instead Elsa watched as the rest surrounded Agdar, forming a shield around him with their own bodies. Admirable loyalty.

She would reward them with death.

* * *

Anna was sitting in silent vigil next to her door when she heard an odd giggle outside.

"Hey!" Hands long since bruised but hope renewed, Anna pushed off the floor and banged on the door once more. "Is someone out there?"

"One second! I'm having – some trouble – reaching – doors are so high up off the ground, whoa, must be a whole new world up there."

It wasn't quite the voice of a child that answered her, though it was suffused with the innocent wonder befitting one. It was a voice full of inflection. Not one burdened by life until its intricacies were snuffed out, but one that still freely expressed joys, as though its owner had never once been disappointed.

Hearing the lock click open, Anna took a step back and waited for her rescuer to show himself. When the door swung open…

Anna nearly fainted on the spot. Instead, she screamed and kicked at the strange creature that had freed her, hitting the doorknob instead when he ducked under her leg.

"Whoa! Close one."

Clutching her foot and hopping in place until the sting wore off, Anna had the opportunity to take a closer look at…him. At least he didn't seem to mind the scrutiny. Instead, he nodded encouragingly until Anna found the courage to speak, and even then it felt so surreal she couldn't be sure she wasn't having a chocolate-induced dream.

"Y-You're a snowman," Anna said. And so he was. Nothing else he could be, with a body made out of snowballs and his single arm nothing but a stick. Large eyes blinked at her so earnestly that she felt guilty for attacking. Strangely, aside from walking and talking, he perfectly resembled another snowman she had seen only hours ago. "Are you even real?"

"All right, let's start this thing over." Stretching out his arm – Anna wondered where the other one had gone – the snowman said, "Hi, I'm Olaf, and I like warm hugs!"

Anna gaped. No wonder he looked familiar. "Are you the Olaf we made?"

Olaf peered up and grinned. "Uh-huh! And you are…?"

"Umm, Anna."

"Oh, that's a weird name," Olaf said. Anna was starting to feel much less charitable when he added, "Can I just call you Anna? That's really, really pretty, but the _Umm_ part makes it all blurgh."

"Uhh, yeah. Sorry, I meant Anna. Just call me Anna."

She watched, hardly daring to believe her eyes, as Olaf nodded and backtracked to the door to retrieve his second arm stuck in the keyhole; Anna assumed that was how he picked the lock. Olaf plopped the twig back into his body, and the arm was suddenly functional again. After giving his reattached arm an experimental flex and seemingly satisfied at its dexterity – Anna had no idea how the wood bent and straightened like it had an actual elbow – Olaf grinned at her again.

"I'm kidding, I remember! Anna! You're the one that Elsa likes so much." Olaf rubbed his chin. "Well, I gotta say that I liked being with you. It was warm. Like summer!"

"Elsa!" Anna had been bursting with questions for Olaf, how he had found her, how he was alive, but at the mention of Elsa, all her questions were forgotten. "Do you know what's going on? Where's Elsa?"

"Oh…" Olaf trailed off and slumped over, having lost his smile. "I'm not seeing a whole lot, but none of it looks good. All I'm getting from her is…you know, same old: fear, pain, anger."

Anna felt her stomach plummet at the thought that Elsa was in danger. She had an inkling of what was going on; Gerda's answer earlier had been obvious enough, and if her father's cryptic words over the last few days hadn't immediately tipped her off, now his intent was clear in retrospect. She had been blind. She had _wanted_ to be blind, _wanted_ to believe that everything would go her way. Always too naïve, just like Elsa had said before.

"Can you lead me to her?" Anna asked.

"Uh-huh, I know exactly where to find her. Elsa's downstairs. Follow me!"

Olaf took off in his shuffling gait, and Anna followed.

All the castle was deserted, and she marveled that she ever found the atmosphere here to be inviting. She was better at lying to herself than she could have ever imagined. All this time Arendelle Castle had been gearing itself for – and Anna felt an ugly pang in her chest at the thought – assassination. Her home had been corrupted into nothing more than a trap for Elsa. How could Pappa resort to such an atrocity? Anna had always known her father to be a peaceful king, and something so much more than that. Pappa was a good man.

At the end of the hall, where the staircase began, Anna pulled Olaf back and peered down. Soldiers stood guard at both the base and at the front doors.

"Olaf, I need you to…" Anna took a closer look at the snowman. Olaf was sitting with his entire body bent over, hands clutching the small nubs of snow that were his feet. "Are you okay?"

"Yeah! Just that, uhh, being around Elsa when she's like this makes me…blurgh." Somewhere in his downcast expression, behind the genuine sadness and concern, Anna saw a hint of…resentment. It was in his eyes. Like Elsa, Anna realized. Expressive as he already was, Olaf also spoke clearly with his eyes.

"Stay here and rest," Anna said.

"I can't help you with Elsa, but I can still get you to her," Olaf answered, and then he winced. "Ooh, that's _really_ not good. We'd better hurry. I'll distract the guards, and then you make a run for it."

"Are you sure?"

"Born ready!" Olaf grinned. "Hehe, I must have picked that up from you."

"But I've never said that to you, right?" When Olaf shrugged and started stretching, Anna smiled at the odd sight. "Well, I'm glad you're good to go. I don't feel very ready."

"You'll be fine! I can't make much of a difference, but I'm sure you can."

"…Yeah." Anna wondered how much of a difference _she_ could make. She rose to her feet and glanced down the stairs before looking towards Olaf again. "Thanks for helping me out."

"You helped me a lot too," Olaf said. "Just remember to hang in there!"

Olaf charged down the staircase, diminutive body rolling down the steps and bouncing off the wall, presence made especially obvious with his loud whoops of sheer delight. Anna watched, half-entranced and half-bemused, as the snowballs that comprised his body disconnected and connected again. All the soldiers downstairs yelled at the bizarre sight and chased him while he dashed down the hall, leaving the way clear. Anna crept down the steps and ran in the opposite direction, towards the dining room.

Each step was leaden with apprehension.

Each step sent a jolt of dread through her veins.

She felt terribly alone. It was the same disquieting silence she experienced while they trekked back to the castle, after building Olaf, and Anna wondered why _she_ couldn't feel anything from Elsa. She would have feared the worst if Olaf hadn't told her otherwise. Anna ran and ran even as the air left her lungs, not from exertion but from the heavy pressure of her terror caught in her chest. Her vision tunneled until all she saw was that door down the hall, that door which would lead her to Elsa.

Anna burst through.

She was welcomed by a sight worse than anything she feared.

Blood was the first thing she noticed. Its smell was so strong and the air so thick that she gagged on the pungent stench, and when she gasped she could taste the copper tang on her tongue. Red saturated the floor and even the walls, rivulets of blood flowing from the countless mangled, ruined bodies littering the room. All their faces were frozen in glassy stares of terror, mouths opened in silent screams.

Worse than that, though, was the woman standing among the carnage. She could hardly recognize Elsa. Her face was ashen and painted with blood, lips drawn back into a bestial snarl. Her entire hand had been colored red along with her blade, as though she drove her hand and sword both through her enemies. Even from across the room her eyes glowed bright, the warm shade of dark blue replaced by a piercing, feverish light. All reason had been swept aside and replaced by base, primal hatred.

Elsa didn't notice her, too intent on her target – Pappa, Anna realized, dull dread immobilizing her body. Her father looked no different from the corpses on the floor, weak, defeated. Agdar was guarded by only two more soldiers, and Elsa stalked towards them with slow, trembling steps. Her entire body shook, and that was when Anna saw the obvious pain behind each of her determined movements. Elsa disregarded it all and trapped the soldier's sword beneath her own, free hand seizing his throat, and ice ripped through his neck. In similarly brutal fashion, she dispatched the other. Agdar backed up against the wall, sword barely remaining in his slackening grip.

"You lose," Elsa spat, and the melodic quality of her voice only made her rage all the uglier, like hearing the screech of metal where once had been song.

"Please. Spare Anna," Agdar breathed.

"You don't have the right to make demands of me. You remember the conditions of your surrender? No negotiation. Anna is mine. Not yours," Elsa said. She raised her sword for the killing blow, and Agdar closed his eyes to await his death.

Anna found her voice at last.

"_Stop!_"

Elsa paused. She and Agdar turned towards her, and as Anna stood there, chest heaving with heavy, labored breaths, she realized she really didn't know what to do anymore. In this impossible situation, was there _anything_ she could do? Already she could tell how this would end. Someone was going to be hurt. Anna only wished that could be her, and her alone.

"Anna! What are you doing here? Go!" Agdar yelled. When he took a step towards her, Elsa shoved him back towards the wall, sword pointed at his throat.

"Stop, Elsa!" Anna ran between them, arms outstretched.

Though her face was still steeled and her eyes still narrowed, their unnatural gleam undiminished, Elsa lowered her sword. "Move aside, Anna. None of this concerns you."

"I can't let you kill Pappa."

"But it's all right if he kills me?"

"Pappa's not a threat to you, please, _please,_ just listen to me–"

"I'll make sure that he's not anymore. Do you know what he's done?" Elsa glared over her shoulder. "I could have died. If our positions were reversed, do you think your coward of a father would spare me?"

"I know," Anna whispered. She knew exactly what had happened. She knew Agdar had started the conflict. "But he's still my father. I can't stand there and do nothing."

"Anna, that's enough," Agdar said, trying to push her aside, but Anna stood her ground. Her father's dwindling strength wasn't enough to move her away. "Anna! Go before you get hurt!"

"Silence," Elsa hissed. "And you, Anna – I've always trusted you. I can believe that you had nothing to do with this, but you will step aside, _now_."

She hadn't even considered that Elsa might think she was part of the assassination. How must it look when it was _her_ who wanted to return to Arendelle, _her_ who urged Elsa to come along? Anna opened and closed her mouth, words failing. All she could manage was a weak, "I-I didn't…"

"Get out of the way," Elsa growled.

"Anna, just do what she says–"

"No! I'm not leaving you here." Anna glanced back at her father, meeting his panicked eyes with her own. She doubted hers were any calmer. When she looked towards Elsa, all she saw was a seemingly bottomless hate, one that had swallowed her into an abyss. "Please, Elsa, this isn't you–"

"What you're seeing is _exactly_ what I am!"

Elsa swung her sword up so that its tip hovered only centimeters away from her throat. Anna looked down, slowly, disbelieving, but the length of steel poised for her life was real. Elsa's hand shook so badly the sword trembled, but she didn't lower her blade.

"I'm not like you," Elsa said. For a moment, just a brief, brief moment, her defenses fell, and the haze in her eyes cleared. "You're a fluke, Anna, kind and generous and loving, but the world isn't like that. _I am not like that._ I'm just a monster with revenge in my bones and murder in my heart."

"That's not–"

"So you have to choose," Elsa continued, hardening her voice again. "Either step away and stay at my side, or stay here with your father, in Arendelle."

"Don't make me choose." Anna shook her head, trying to hold back her tears, but sobs choked in her throat and escaped through her voice. "You can't make me give up one of you."

"Then you don't understand me after all."

"I do! I understand. More than anyone, and I can prove it to you," Anna said. Given the choice, she would never use the reliquary to access Elsa's thoughts. She'd always seen it as a violation of privacy, but this time, this time she had to. She didn't have a choice. So Anna reached for the link between them, searching out the familiar, ever-present warmth of their bond.

Nothing.

"Well?" Elsa might have smiled. Anna wasn't sure. It was just a pained twitch at the corner of her lips, the beginning of a wry smile. "Do you see my thoughts, Anna?"

"I-I can't," Anna breathed.

She couldn't see anything. Anna reached for the reliquary again, desperate for its help, but there was nothing for her to find. She was grasping at a shadow. It wasn't blocked. It was gone. It was why she had that sense of loneliness earlier before, Anna realized, horrific realization dawning much too late, because the reliquary was gone. It was Elsa whose presence she had missed.

She had nothing to help her understand anymore.

"In that case," Elsa murmured, "I'll ask you again to choose."

"Elsa…" Anna turned to her father, the tears in her eyes obscuring her vision. She couldn't let him die. Agdar might have opened his mouth to say something, but Anna looked back to Elsa before she could change her mind, before she could be selfish enough to do the wrong thing. She let the tears fall and said, choking out her words, feeling each one hurt worse than any pain she had ever felt, "I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry."

Silence. Elsa withdrew her sword, and Anna wanted nothing more than to reach out for her, to pull her back from the precipice. She couldn't do even that. She was rooted to the spot, unable to move, unable to think. When Elsa looked her in the eyes, Anna wished there was anger reflected there, betrayal. Instead Elsa looked at her with the vacant eyes of a corpse. She could have been one of the dead.

"Are you afraid?" Elsa asked.

She wished she could lie.

"…Yes," Anna answered.

It hurt so much to admit.

"Well, I'm not." Elsa stepped away with her hand pressed against the wound in her side, shaking her head as bitter, choked laughs left her lips. "I told you before the only thing I feared was you leaving me...and now I'm not afraid of anything."

"I remember," Anna choked out. She stretched out her hand, but Elsa stabbed her sword into the floor and it stood there, quivering, an impassable barrier between them. "I love you, Elsa."

Elsa said nothing. Her wry smile faded. A blank mask took its place, harder than steel, and she resembled more than ever the Elsa that Anna had first met, the conquering queen she had glimpsed from afar. She bore no resemblance to the Elsa from only hours prior, the one with whom Anna had lived and laughed and loved. Anna looked at her face now, and saw a stranger.

"I could never say it before, but…I loved you," Elsa said. Her words cut deeper than her sword ever could. Anna wished it was still the blade poised at her throat. Not this. Never this. "And I should thank you. Because now you've made me untouchable. There's nothing left for me to be afraid of anymore."

"I'm sorry," Anna whispered.

It was all she could say, but it would never be enough.

"Don't be."

Elsa departed.

Anna stayed.
