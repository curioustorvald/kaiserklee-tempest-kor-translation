**Chapter 27: Prisons and Misgivings**

"Describe to me exactly what happened and how you felt while under control. Spare no details. Even the most insignificant observation might be of use."

Elsa watched Oliver as he considered, following each and every motion with a careful eye. Oliver was not a prisoner and so she left his hands unbound, but she kept her distance and stood behind her desk rather than sit, ready to counter at the slightest hint of insurrection. She doubted he would try to attack her again. Even if he _did_ he was no danger, but there was no harm in caution. At the very least, with greater distance between them she would be able to stop herself from killing the prince on reflex.

"It was like…" Oliver grimaced. "Speaking plainly, Your Majesty, I'm afraid I am unable give you the full details. Each time I think back on the memory, the hazier it becomes."

"Which was why I summoned you here so promptly."

Oliver nodded. "It was a peculiar sensation. I was waiting, and all was as it should be, and my thoughts were my own. And then…I heard a voice. In my head, I heard someone speak."

"Describe them."

"I-It was not a beautiful voice that he spoke with," Oliver said quickly, and a shudder wracked through the length of his body. "I wish it were some silky thing. If it were so false then I might be free of its clutches now, but – I admit that I'm shaken. It was a very _human_ voice."

Considering what Anna had told her about the Sorcerer, he was far from human. Elsa frowned. Perhaps he was better than her at pretending. "How was it human?"

"Imperfection," Oliver said. "It was full of imperfection. It was a broken voice, and somehow his pain became my pain too, and when he spoke, everything he said made sense. I had never heard anything more reasonable in my life, and I couldn't understand why I had never thought the same as him before. And then the pain and the suffering became too much for my mind to handle, and I – I snapped."

"You attacked me," Elsa said.

"Yes. I attacked you because that man told me to attack you. I was so blinded by anguish that I couldn't do anything but. I wanted…" Oliver pause, exhaling and rubbing his eyes. "I just wanted to be told what to do. I needed guidance, and he gave me direction. I became convinced that I wanted to attack you."

"What exactly did he tell you?"

"I don't remember. It wasn't the words that mattered. I wasn't convinced because of his words, or even his voice. It was just the idea finally being introduced. I was convinced before he ever had to try."

Elsa frowned. "From what you are telling me, it sounds as though…"

Oliver dropped to one knee and bowed his head. "I never needed to _be_ convinced because I had always _been_ convinced. What he told me was only the thoughts I always had, deep down."

"Which would explain why it sounded reasonable," Elsa mused. "So then, this brainwashing…"

"It is not brainwashing at all," Oliver finished. "This brand of hypnosis targets subconscious desire and removes your inhibition. If there had never been a preexisting desire to manipulate, I would not have done what I did. I beg your forgiveness, Your Majesty."

"…You have always _wanted_ to kill me, then. Or at least wanted me gone," Elsa amended, cutting off the strangled protest about to leave Oliver's lips. She sat down and waved her hand. "Rise, Oliver."

"Y-Your Majesty?"

"I would be surprised, even doubtful, if you harbored no resentment towards me at all," Elsa said. "I am not of your blood, and yet this throne that should be passed through your family has become mine. It is admirable that you have repressed yourself for so long."

Oliver bowed. Once again he fell to his knees, and this time he bowed over completely and placed his forehead flat against the floor. "If I could wipe out that part of me that selfishly wanted the throne returned to us, I would. It has been our honor to have you as Queen. Please forgive me, Your Majesty."

"You are only human," Elsa said, laughing a small, wry laugh, but she offered no explanation when Oliver looked at her questioningly. "But thank you, Oliver. You are dismissed."

Oliver did not protest this time. Rising from the floor, the eleventh prince backed out of the door and shut it behind himself, leaving Elsa by herself.

She felt terribly alone. It was a reality she had always known, but only through her own reasoning. Now cold, hard _fact_ had proven that all the princes bore grudges against her. Alvard had made it obvious, and his attack on her hardly needed the explanation of sorcery. But even Oliver, unfailingly helpful and one of the rare few princes not ambitious for power, had chafed under her rule. She could trust no one. She could never let down her guard for an instant, even at her own home.

There was still Anna.

If there was anyone she could trust, it was her.

But could she _really_ trust Anna?

At one time, Anna had hated her for conquering Arendelle. Arendelle was _still_ under her rule, forced into subservience, and worse, suffering now from a drought only being relieved by the handouts Elsa deigned to give them like delivering scraps to a starving dog. How did Anna feel about her now? She professed love. But could every last trace of her previous contempt be gone, or had she only become better at hiding it? Was Anna a threat like all the others?

"Something troubles you."

Elsa jerked back in her seat when the deep rumble of a voice broke through her concentration. Without her conscious command, a jagged wall of ice rose in a semicircle around her desk. Behind the icicles jutting forward and hovering an inch away from his eyes, Gustaf blinked once and sighed wearily. Elsa took several deep breaths to calm herself, and slowly the icicles retracted and the wall collapsed into a pile of crystal shards.

"How did you get in without me noticing?" Elsa asked.

"You were so distracted that you might not have noticed the world ending around you, let alone a single shell of a man." Gustaf chuckled and shook his head, more so to himself than for her sake. Claiming a seat at the sofa and dwarfing the thing with his bulk, Gustaf asked, "What troubles you?"

"What makes you think that I would tell you?"

"Nothing," Gustaf said. "I was only offering advice should you seek it."

"You think I would seek it from you?"

Gustaf shrugged. "You are too far gone to ask for help, too far gone, perhaps, to recognize that you are not infallible. It is not so shameful to be human."

No. Gustaf was wrong. Maybe she had needed guidance once, but no longer, not from him, not from anyone. Just as she prepared to reply, Gustaf cocked an eyebrow as though preempting her response and Elsa bit back her retort, willing herself to calm down. She hid her anger. It wouldn't do to reveal her hand now. Every time they spoke she had the nagging suspicion that Gustaf knew more than he let on, and if he offered his information freely, well…

She would play his game.

"You are speaking of more than needing assistance," Elsa said, watching the man carefully, taking in each and every motion that might betray his thoughts. "All this about being human…"

"Perceptive as always, though perhaps not always accompanied with the proper insight." Gustaf only smiled when Elsa narrowed her eyes. "Well, continue on."

"What do you know about being human?" Elsa asked.

"I believe that we are not born with humanity."

Of all the answers she had been expecting, that was not one.

"Pardon?"

"Self is a difficult concept, and solitude breeds contempt. Often, we need assistance," Gustaf said, still smiling that small, sardonic smile, but now Elsa noticed the bitter tinge that marred his face like poison seeping through his lined skin. "We must learn those things that make us human. But…my chance has been robbed from me." Absentmindedly rubbing at his left ring finger, Gustaf asked, "Has it been for you as well, Elsa?"

"…Not robbed. Freely given," Elsa said.

Gustaf hummed low in the back of his throat. "But a cage is only a cage when one does not realize its existence. If you can recognize the prison encaging you, then you are in your mind already free. Evasion, denial, delusion…" Gustaf said, looking directly into her eyes as Elsa wondered just _what_ he knew about her, "I expected more from you."

"…Why?"

"You remind me of myself, I suppose."

Gustaf rose, seemingly pushing off the sofa with great effort, hulking frame almost clumsy. But Elsa had always been able to see the deadly grace lurking behind his movements. Gustaf hid it well, but he had been trained just as she had, perhaps even better. All the others believed him to be obsolete, atrophied since falling out of favor with Markus. Elsa knew better. Perhaps Gustaf did not purposely hide it at all. Elsa was beginning to think him so weary that he simply no longer cared to keep up a front as she did.

"How?" Elsa asked.

She asked, but she could see it too, their similarity.

Gustaf paced the room and strode to the grandfather clock. It was about to strike twelve. Its hand was seconds away from reaching the peak, ticking down each one with a steady click as Gustaf observed, frowning so heavily the lines of his face creased. And then with one second to go, Gustaf reached out and pinched the pointer between his thumb and index. With a shuddering rattle, the clock halted.

"We are both out of time. Do you see now what we have lost?" Gustaf asked.

When he let go, the clock never resumed.

Elsa looked away. She was losing control of this conversation before she ever gained it. She did not see and yet she could understand, just a little. Hovering on the barest edge of comprehension, she could feel the pain of loss and yet could not name _what_ she had lost.

"I cannot." Elsa forced her eyes to focus on Gustaf again, but her voice betrayed her. She could not speak louder than a whisper. "I would have sent you to Baaj. You would have been reunited with your family. Would you not be happier far away from all this?"

"My family is gone," Gustaf chuckled.

"…Gone?"

"I was lost and then I found purpose. When I failed," Gustaf said, chuckle fading with an abrupt pause, "I lost it again. I have no future anymore. If you will heed my advice, Elsa, I offer you this–"

"I will not," Elsa said quickly.

Gustaf nodded, moved to the door and, without waiting for dismissal, left her.

Elsa sat back against her chair and closed her eyes.

After Hans, Anna was at a lost where to go.

She began the walk back where she came, unsure of her destination but unwilling to do nothing. Maybe a walk would clear her mind. She was more than just confused, her thoughts turbulent, jumping from one thought to the next before the last had ever finished forming. Elsa was distant, Alek was imprisoned, Hans was withdrawn. Unwittingly, one other person came to her mind, one other person she might possibly confide in.

Alek had warned her that Edmund might be dangerous, but part of Anna still refused to believe it. It was Edmund, the second of the princes she had met but the first she had befriended. It was Edmund who had encouraged her all this time, Edmund who had guided her to Elsa. Edmund, who smiled and laughed and was so much like her, could not be dangerous, not to Anna.

But before she could make a decision, Anna passed the twelfth room.

Maybe it was for the best.

Anna kept walking, but she stopped when she heard a noise coming from the eleventh room. She had just passed it, but the sound of trickling water was difficult to ignore in the silent hallway. Eleventh, so that room had belonged to Reid. When the noise sounded again, Anna investigated against her better judgment. Pushing the door open, Anna looked in.

It was Edmund.

Anna assumed that the out-of-place miniature table in the middle of the room had not always been there, so it was likely Edmund had carted that in himself. Edmund sat on the floor on one end of the table with a glass of red wine in his hand, though Anna could see much of it had been spilled onto the carpet. On the other end of the table was another, untouched glass of wine. Beside him was a wine cart, filled with reds and whites and more, adorned by several types of glasses.

"Oh, Anna," Edmund said. Strangely, he held out his glass with one hand, braced his arm with his other, and deliberately poured out his wine on the floor, moving in a slow horizontal line until the last of the wine trickled out.

"What are you doing here?" Anna asked. And then she remembered how Edmund had once burned incense in the library for Tobias. "Another mini-funeral for Reid?"

"You guessed it. Libation is a strange superstition, but I hope that Reid gets this." Edmund stood and gestured at the wine cart, at the same time sliding out another bottle and appraising it with a fine eye. "Pinot Noir. Reid always did like his drink, so I figured…"

"I remember," Anna said.

She remembered well. Reid had forced her to indulge in his habit as well.

"It's not an excuse, but Reid was drunk and frustrated and – I'm just saying that he wouldn't have attacked you if he had been in his right mind," Edmund stammered. Afterward, he busied himself opening the bottle of wine.

"How do you know about that?" Anna asked, and Edmund stilled.

"…What do you mean?"

"I never told you about Reid attacking me," Ana said. "I never even saw you again after that. Only Alek and Hans know, and they wouldn't have told you. So how do you know?"

Instead of answering, Edmund popped off the cork of his Pinot Noir. Picking up his glass, he refilled it to a third and stopped. "Word gets around," Edmund said, bringing the glass up to his nose and sloshing the wine about, getting a good sense of its aroma. Satisfied, he made to pour it out.

"Alek suspects you," Anna said.

Edmund paused midway through pouring the wine for Reid. Bending down, he placed the glass back on the table, then straightened and smiled at Anna. It was not his usual smile. Lacking something. If Anna were honest, his smile was not genuine. It looked pained, and stiff, as though his facial muscles had not been worked in some time.

"I'm not surprised," Edmund said. "I know I look suspicious."

"You really do."

"Do you suspect me?"

"No," Anna said immediately, and Edmund frowned. It was maybe the first time Anna had ever seen him frown like this. His expression carried an edge that it never possessed before. Just this once, he looked his age and she was reminded that the boy was older than her.

"You should suspect me," Edmund said. "Why don't you suspect me?"

"Because I have faith," Anna said, and Edmund's frown deepened.

"Why do you have faith though?" Edmund asked again, crossing his arm over his chest and rubbing at his temple with his free hand. "What if you were wrong? What if I _was_ behind all this?"

"If I were wrong, then I would have been wrong. Nothing else. You can't live life never being wrong. Worrying about it is pointless," Anna said, and Edmund widened his eyes as though she had said something much more incredulous. It was only common sense to Anna. "I would rather have faith and be proven wrong once or twice than doubt everyone around me."

Chuckling, Edmund slid down the wall and slumped to the floor. "You're really something else, Anna. I said that optimism was my one redeeming trait, but as expected you _are_ better than me."

"Not better," Anna said. "After all, you taught me."

Edmund whipped his head up to stare with wide eyes. "You're saying that, what, you learned from me?" Anna said nothing. A moment later his eyes dimmed, and he looked away with a tiny snort. "On the contrary, I'm learning from you. I wish I were brave like you, Anna."

"...Is there something you want to tell me?"

"No," Edmund said quickly. "I cannot tell you anything. Just remember to be careful, Anna. Please take care of yourself. As for your faith…"

"I won't change," Anna said.

Edmund nodded. "I expected nothing less."

Anna left him to his funeral.

* * *

A week already.

It had been a week since Elsa returned and the tension between them never lessened in the slightest, had maybe even worsened as more and more time passed with their troubles unresolved. Anna could count on one hand the number of conversations they had held. It was infuriating.

Mornings were an uncomfortable experience. Each time Elsa rose at some ridiculously early hour, Anna considered pretending she was still asleep despite being wide-eyed and, though she was not well-rested, so filled with nervous energy that she could never sleep for more than four hours. She might have tried to just shut her eyes, if only to avoid the inevitable strained platitudes. Anna never did, though. Elsa would see through her clumsy act without even trying, but Anna also knew that their strained morning ritual was the majority of their interaction nowadays. She wouldn't miss it.

"Good morning," Elsa said stiffly.

"Good morning," Anna said back, holding in her sigh.

"Did you sleep well?"

"Yeah," Anna would say, despite the black circles starting to develop around her eyes, and despite knowing the answer, Anna felt obligated to ask, "You?"

"Well enough," Elsa would answer. Which was her way of saying that she had not slept at all. It was _well enough_ because she didn't actually need to sleep. "I'll be in my office."

"You always are."

By the time Anna mustered the courage to say that, Elsa had already crossed the room and could not hear, would not turn around for her.

And when they had meals together, Elsa reverted back to her old habit of forgoing food, though unlike before she seemed to have little interest in even watching Anna. She sat there deep in thought, sometimes swirling a glass of wine around, other times not even bothering to pretend at all.

One day, Anna told her, "You should eat."

"You know I have no need," Elsa answered. Today she sat with her hands neatly folded in her lap, chin raised and back straight. Only her clothing reflected any informality at all, her sharper, armored guise discarded in favor of an elegant gown made of some light, floaty material, but her demeanor was the same as when she sat before her court.

"How does that work?" Anna asked on impulse. Elsa tilted her head, and Anna continued, repressing a shiver at the blank expression, "How come you don't need to eat?"

Elsa frowned and looked away.

"How come?" Anna asked again.

"I am sustained by the magic of the reliquary," Elsa said, finally turning her gaze on Anna. A tiny spark smoldered there though she tried to repress her anger. It burned. Not like flame, but the bite of frost.

"What does that mean?" Anna asked quietly. Only when she consciously did so did Elsa breathe. She needed neither food nor drink. Her heart no longer beat, the essential, human part of it carved out.

Anna knew long before Elsa answered, and Elsa knew that she knew so she never bothered.

"It's not just that the reliquary is sustaining you. It's all that's keeping you alive," Anna whispered.

For all intents and purposes, Elsa had already committed suicide.

Anna no longer had any appetite. Elsa excused herself politely, but she left in such an uncharacteristic rush that Anna didn't have the courage to follow after her.

It was hours later, hours after night fell and hours after Anna lay down wide-eyed in bed that Elsa returned. Anna pretended to be asleep, closing her eyes and making sure to breathe in and out in a steady rhythm. After what felt like an eternity, Elsa released a tiny sigh. Anna turned over to see Elsa staring unblinkingly up at the ceiling. Ann tried, just once, to offer her comfort from whatever was bothering her. She extended her hand, to grasp her hand, to touch her shoulder; Anna hardly knew what exactly she was planning, but it didn't matter. Elsa shied away and turned her back.

It was the last time Anna ever tried to touch Elsa again.

It was a small relief that the Sorcerer never haunted her dreams again, and Anna wondered if that time before had been magic at all or simply her own fears. She never voiced the thought aloud, but more and more often she saw parallels between Elsa and the Sorcerer. It was their walk, their stance. It was the way they carried themselves, their paradoxical mixture of self-confidence and self-loathing that made them living contradictions. Anna looked at Elsa and saw the Sorcerer, just as she had the opposite.

And to top it all off, Alek was still imprisoned, Hans was still refusing to admit visitors, and Edmund was actively avoiding her. She had no one left to turn to, except…

"Wow. Sounds like you have it rough," Kristoff said.

"I don't know what to do," Anna said, sitting down on a bale of hay while Kristoff alternated between feeding Sven and feeding himself with the carrots she brought over. "I thought everything would be better when Elsa got back, but it all seems to be _worse_."

"You can't really expect her to magically solve all your problems," Kristoff said. Anna turned a pointed look outside the stables, where the sky was eternally grey and the snow inches thick. Kristoff groaned and continued, "You know what I meant."

"I don't even know what's going on!" Anna grabbed a handful of hay and threw it across the stall. Sven followed it with his eyes, then turned and blinked at Anna with large eyes. It was ridiculous. A reindeer had no business looking so chastising. Anna held her knees to her chest and mumbled, "I just wish Elsa would start talking to me again."

"…Do you want some advice?"

"Are you some kind of love expert now?" Anna grumbled.

Kristoff looked away, clearing his throat and rubbing the back of his neck. "No, but I have friends who are love experts."

"Seriously, _you_ have friends who are love experts?" Anna turned to stare at Sven, ignoring the reindeer's enthusiastic nod. "I'm not buying it."

"Whatever," Kristoff said, shrugging. "I think you're avoiding her just as much as she's avoiding you. If you want her to talk to you, maybe you have to be the one to talk to her first."

"You think I don't try?"

"Try harder," Kristoff suggested. "You need to sit her down. Look her dead in the eye. And tell her to please stop making life difficult for me because I'm about to go crazy."

"You mean for me, because _I'm_ about to go crazy," Anna said.

"No, I'm obviously getting the worst of it since everyone has decided to come to me, rant about their life crises, but not take my advice." Kristoff tossed the last of the carrots to Sven, not even bothering to take a bite for himself. "Between you and Edmund, I really will go crazy soon."

"Edmund still comes around here?"

Kristoff nodded, and Anna supposed that it made sense. She had met the prince here, caked up to his elbows in dirt and possibly something much more obscene. She had met Edmund here, and then she decided that Elsa gave her good vibes. Because of her kindness, because of her eyes that had smiled more than her lips, because something told Anna that beneath the exterior of hardened ice there was something more than just a conqueror or a queen. Anna had decided that she would give Elsa a chance. It was this spot right here that had given birth to the chance that led to her faith in Elsa.

"You're right," Anna said. "I'm going to talk to her."

It was an easy decision after all.
