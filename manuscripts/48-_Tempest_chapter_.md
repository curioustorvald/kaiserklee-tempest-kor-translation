**Chapter 48: And All the Devils Are Here**

Hans was sitting outside at the gardens that led into the forest path, staring absentmindedly at the darkened sky, when Oliver approached him.

"Have you heard the news?" Oliver asked, sitting beside him without preamble. Hans swiveled his wheelchair to face the elder prince, whose expression was hopeful, though tinged with dark humor.

"Agdar is coming," Hans said simply.

News had come from the sentries. The Arendellian fleet, and that of Corona, Weselton – and every other kingdom unfortunate enough to cross paths with the Southern Isles – had amassed into one massive naval fleet. They would be here within the day, hours, perhaps, sped by the prevailing winds. Soon, the battle for the Southern Isles would begin.

"It makes me nervous," Oliver admitted, but he was grinning too. "I also heard that there's been some unrest in the common districts. Guess what Anna has done?"

"Nothing." Anna had barely been seen since the time she announced her rule. She retreated to her quarters, or was otherwise occupied in the cemetery, and sometimes the upper reaches of the castle.

"Of course," Oliver said. "More and more people will be joining our cause."

"You know that it doesn't matter in the long run," Hans said wearily, rubbing his eyes. He had not slept well in quite some time. Not since Alek had been frozen. "Agdar is coming to his death. That…thing…is too powerful to be stopped."

It was not Anna. It might be wearing her face, but Hans refused to believe that was Anna. Alek had stayed true to that faith, and Hans would not be the one to tarnish his memory.

"Yes," Oliver said. "Shall we talk numbers?"

"…Of course." Hans exhaled. "While I was Captain of the Guard, I did get to know some of the soldiers; Alek was even better liked. I can guarantee thirty, maybe forty will join us. Perhaps fifty, at the most."

"And I should have another twenty or thirty," Oliver said. Standing up and stretching his back, several joints cracked. "Eighty between us. Eighty people, against the standing army of the Southern Isles, and the most powerful sorceress in the world."

"Wonderful odds," Hans said.

Silence between them, but the silence was comfortable. Hans concentrated on simply breathing, once again watching the path that led to his mother's unmarked grave. She would be proud. Unlike his fool crusade to avenge her on his brothers, this time, what he was doing – he knew that she would be proud.

"We don't stand a chance," Hans said, and Oliver grew grim. "Not even with Agdar and his army. Not even if the commoners revolt. Nobody stands a chance, except…Elsa."

As much as he wanted to place importance on their task – Hans knew otherwise. None of their efforts would matter if Anna was not stopped. Perhaps, once, numbers and momentum might have been enough to overwhelm Elsa; but not this new threat. Anna was now beyond their mortal comprehension. Slim hope it might be, but they needed Elsa.

"Are you…really sure that she will return?" Oliver shifted, and Hans knew his fear, the fear of death but even more so, the fear of failure. "For all we know, her corpse could be at the bottom of the ocean."

"I'm sure," Hans said.

"Why?" Oliver asked.

"Because Anna is here." Hans rubbed his throat, smiling at the memory of Elsa threatening him. "You underestimate the lengths she would go to save Anna. We just need to buy some time. Revolution always carries risk, but I would rather die with dignity than live with this shame."

At length, Oliver nodded. After asking him for permission – for which Hans was grateful – Oliver wheeled him back into the castle, where there was at least some modicum of warmth. Together, they looked closely at the halls where they had grown up. Soon, they would be filled with the rancor of battle. These were the last hours of an uneasy peace, presided over by their monstrous new queen, ruling from high above in her cold spires.

"You…remind me of Saul," Oliver said. Hans raised an eyebrow, and he hurried to add, "Not the way he had become, but…the person that he had been, the one that I thought would make a good king."

Hans smiled.

"I'm not sure I trust your judgment."

* * *

Elsa had expected the memories to cease after showing the reliquary being created, but they did not. Visions continued with desperate fervor, quicker now, so that she could barely comprehend one memory before the next started. It was an outpouring of suffering, and she could do nothing but watch.

Markus might have killed Edmund in his sleep if he had not woken up in time, but Edmund did, and he knew well enough to feign ignorance. Even while he felt the throbbing pain in his chest, the hollowness of his loss, he pretended that he could not remember carving out his heart, or even ever learning magic.

"Is something wrong?" Edmund asked, smiling as though he could not now perceive the bitterness of Markus' gaze. And then, looking at the calendar with feigned surprise, he shouted, "Wait! There's no way that thing can be right. It's off by a whole month!"

Elsa now recognized the same half-suspicion, half-hesitance that Markus had displayed in the future. When he had interrogated Edmund almost immediately after she woke him from his cryogenic sleep, Markus had been trying to ascertain whether his memories…returned. Edmund had fooled him then, just as he did before. Markus hated Gustaf enough to torture Edmund, and loved Gustaf enough to keep Edmund alive.

And Edmund flawlessly kept up his mask, guided by the suggestion that Gustaf planted in his mind. Here was the Edmund that Elsa had known, the one who was childish but unfailingly optimistic, and kind. Oh, he had truly been that way before; but now, she saw an imitation of the boy he was before the reliquary. Edmund knew no other personality to be had, and so he had held onto that mask well into adulthood.

"It scares me more than your other mask," Elsa admitted, though Edmund could not respond.

She watched him grow up.

Edmund was scared, because there was now an unrelenting hunger that dominated his every thought. Elsa felt only an echo of it through him, and she was repulsed – because she had felt such a thing too, though she had not recognized it, just as Edmund did not consciously recognize it in himself. It numbed every other sensation, drowned out every other emotion, with an all-consuming craving. They craved completion. They craved to fill the emptiness within them with something, anything.

She watched him hurt himself just to feel something else.

Edmund could never sleep at night, and after an entire day of his thespian performance, he sank to the floor and wept for his heart.

"I don't understand, I don't understand," Edmund mumbled, again and again, until the night faded back into day, and he put the mask back on.

Time flashed forward in a dizzying vortex.

One night, less than a year later, he could not bear the silence of his room. He crept outside, walked into the forests, following a deliberate path as though beckoned. Disregarding the branches cutting into his skin, perhaps even relishing the pain, he made his way deeper into the woods.

"Hans, I'm sorry. Mamma is so sorry."

Elsa widened her eyes at the sight of Anya. Hidden behind another tree, Edmund watched as Anya tied rope around the branch of a great oak, watched as Anya wound it around her neck. Elsa did not understand when she saw Edmund breathe deeply, eyes becoming glassy and lips parting slightly. His hands wrapped around the tree, gripping so tightly that his nails dug into the wood, and his entire body shook with…pleasure. Disgust filled her at that revelation, and Elsa looked away from him.

Edmund was feeding on her death.

Anya choked to death upon that tree branch, and Edmund watched in ecstasy. He could feel her life ebbing away, the wax and wane of her strength as her instincts fought for survival. Her legs kicked, struggling for purchase, and she gasped for air that she so desperately needed. Edmund watched with unconcealed awe, every moment bringing him greater contentment.

"Save her!" Elsa cried, but Edmund only ever watched.

Until at last, Anya stopped struggling.

At the moment of her death, the climax of pleasure washed over his senses. Edmund felt his knees buckle, and his eyes closed against his will to savor the sensation. All the while, Elsa shared in the echoes, but only felt sick. It was sweet intoxication. It was the greatest sense of release, greater than any ecstasy. But it was so _wrong_ to sense death this way, to feed, to gorge on death.

Had she also done this without knowing?

Once the deed was done, Edmund remained there, trembling as the last throes of pleasure rippled through his body. But every high ended. Before long, Edmund came to his senses and saw, really saw what was in front of him, and the child stumbled back. Edmund pushed himself away, screaming.

"Wh-What…?" Edmund retched, and then he vomited up the minimal contents of his stomach, crying with fear and disgust. For that brief moment, the hunger had been satisfied. It had been euphoric, but now the hunger was back, stronger than before. "What's _wrong_ with me? _What's wrong with me?_"

Time passed, but Edmund never forgot that sensation.

It haunted him.

"Edmund…?"

Gustaf knelt in front of the unresponsive boy, who stared unblinkingly into the fireplace. Edmund had such a deadened expression that it scared Gustaf enough to give up restraint and reach out, but Edmund only shied away. Afraid that he would hurt him. Afraid that he would do something monstrous again. Gustaf drew back, his throat bobbing, and Edmund slowly managed to flash his usual smile.

"Nothing's wrong."

"Please, Edmund, just talk to me," Gustaf said. "You can tell me anything, anything at all. I promised you before that I would be there if you need."

There was a spasm of indecision.

Just for a moment, Edmund had really considered...

"Really," Edmund said, smiling, "I'm all right."

Every now and then, Gustaf would try to reconnect with him, but Edmund put up his falsities and his smile, and he would never allow anyone to come close. There was only the illusion of such. Edmund only asked questions, never answered them. Another few months passed. Food no longer had any taste. Air was no longer sweet. His mind had compartmentalized, granting him eidetic memory. Elsa recognized these things. She had _welcomed_ these things, once. Seeing this boy, she wondered why.

"Nice to meet you! I'm Number Twelve – Edmund. I hope we can be friends!"

Elsa watched Edmund introduce himself to her, and realized that this was the day she was brought to the Southern Isles. Her younger self stood at the front of the throne room while the princes introduced themselves one at a time, and Edmund's bright smile had fooled her then. She watched herself smile back, but she could read Edmund's thoughts – and was surprised to find that he _did_ mean what he said.

"Y-Yeah," Elsa had said, thrown but pleased by his enthusiasm. "Of course, I hope so too."

"Well then," Edmund said, "I guess we already are since we both want to be friends."

Rather than hold out his hand for a handshake like everyone else, Edmund had raised his hand, palm-first, and Elsa had bemusedly given him a high-five.

Elsa saw many of the experiences they had shared, the two of them playing chess with Gustaf, the two of them playing pranks on Saul. In the middle of the hierarchy of power that was the Southern Isles, Edmund had been a place where none of that mattered. What she did not realize was that she, herself, had kept Edmund sane for a time. She could _feel_ how much he treasured these memories, and it stunned her to her core that the reliquary would bother storing away any of these.

Admiration.

Edmund looked at her and saw what he thought he should be. Here was this girl who had gone through so much pain, been cast aside by her parents, but now she excelled at every expectation Markus set. She was strong. And most importantly, she kept her integrity. Edmund watched her train, and marveled that she never killed, never seemed to enjoy causing pain to others, and he would remember Anya with shame. He resolved to be better than that. He resolved to keep himself from becoming a monster again.

"Checkmate," Gustaf said.

Elsa remembered this memory well. Almost two years into her time at the Southern Isles, and she was only just beginning to interact with Gustaf. She was situated a good distance away from the couches, hiding behind a potted plant as Gustaf and Edmund played chess. Edmund sat so far forward he dangled precariously over the edge of the couch, and his entire face screwed up with utmost concentration as he glared at the chessboard. On the other hand, Gustaf looked completely at ease.

"I made all the right moves!" Edmund exclaimed. "How did I lose again?"

"You're overthinking and losing adaptability. Sometimes, you have to step back and look at the greater picture." Gustaf turned to Elsa, who had thought herself very discrete as she watched. "Would you like to join us, Elsa? You've stood there a while."

Back then, she had not understood why he offered. Now she realized that Gustaf was _grateful_ to her for managing to help Edmund.

"O-Oh, I'm sorry. I wouldn't want to impose–"

Moving so fast Elsa couldn't react with much more than a yelp, Edmund bounded up, took her by the hand, and dragged her over to the couches before sitting her down in his own seat across from Gustaf. Edmund himself plopped down on another couch and huffed.

"You can get slaughtered in my place, Elsa," Edmund said. "Oh! Actually, I've been wondering. Can I call you 'Sis'? It's all right if I call you that, right?"

"Don't scare the girl. Edmund can be very enthusiastic, I apologize," Gustaf sighed, rearranging the pieces on his side of the board. Elsa hastened to mimic him for her own field. "Nicely done."

"Th-Thank you. And that's fine, Edmund," Elsa had said, but her voice left as a pitiful squeak and Gustaf raised an eyebrow. Watching this take place, the older, more experienced Elsa felt such embarrassment that she almost wished the reliquary would move on. But…these were happier, simpler times.

Edmund grinned. "What did I say? We're family now. Calling Elsa 'Sis' isn't such a big deal."

"As if anyone could refuse when you ask so suddenly," Gustaf said dryly.

"It really is fine," Elsa said again, and Edmund cheered.

How pleased Edmund had been! Elsa saw the genuine delight in his eyes, and after seeing him fake the emotion for so long, the difference was startling. It was incomprehensible that she could have such influence on him, but the proof was here. He had truly considered her family. He had believed that she was everything good.

"How wrong you were about me," Elsa muttered.

As the years passed and Edmund gained some semblance of control, it seemed that he might be all right.

Everything changed once she created her reliquary.

"Markus has decreed that I shall rule in his absence," Elsa had declared. "Until the day of his return, my commands shall be his commands as well. You will address me as Queen Elsa."

Elsa looked up at herself seated on the throne, cold and distant; and she could understand the depth of the betrayal that Edmund felt when she lorded over them. She was supposed to be his sister and his friend, and yet here she was, unrecognizable.

"For your betrayal against Markus," Elsa had said, staring down at Gustaf with what she once thought was mercy, "I sentence you with exile to Baaj."

Edmund leapt from his spot, and of course he had protested, of course, when he _knew_ the horrors the island contained. Had he thought that she, too, knew what exactly her order meant?

"No!" Edmund said, turning to Gustaf and waiting for him to say something. When he did not, Edmund growled and looked back to Elsa. "You aren't sending him anywhere."

"Edmund, I grant him this as a boon. I am reuniting him with his wife and child."

How that must have sounded! Elsa shook her head. She had been blind.

Edmund clenched his fists, magic roiling at his fingertips for the first time in years.

"Why are you doing this? What are you–?" Edmund cut himself off and he looked at her, studied her face, until he recognized the same hollowness. It was in her eyes. Horror overcame his features, and Elsa remembered wondering _why_ he was acting this way. She had worried for him.

"Edmund–"

"You're heartless," Edmund whispered, and Elsa slammed her hand on the throne to silence him. Gustaf hurried to apologize for him, but Elsa had already closed herself off entirely.

"Perhaps I am heartless," Elsa had said. "But there is no use for the heart."

She had actually managed to convince herself that was true.

When Edmund saw her hollow eyes, he instinctively _knew_ that she had done the unthinkable. She had carved out her heart, and willingly. She had rejected all of those things he had seen as her strengths, had thrown away her identity even as he struggled to hold onto his, and he snapped entirely. On that day, the fifteen-year-old Edmund, having suffered through ten years of pain, having managed to conquer that pain through sheer force of will – broke.

"Fine, I was wrong to think you were anything else," Edmund spat, but really, he had been thinking – _I was wrong to think_ I _could be anything else._ From that day on, he would no longer be Edmund.

"It was…because of me," Elsa murmured.

She had pushed him over the edge.

Now Edmund gave in to the hunger and he began to use his powers again. He started killing animals, any stray cats and dogs that he could find, any birds that still populated the frozen kingdom. Using his powers, he would stalk through the darkness and kill with the shadows, feeding on the deaths, again and again. Each time the hunger would pass, but for shorter and shorter times; and the hunger would return, stronger and stronger, until the intervals became unbearable. Animals were no longer enough.

Elsa saw Edmund crouched in the darkness of his room, downing stolen medicine and narcotics just so his mind would be free of pain. And God, his chest – Edmund gripped the area over his missing heart, and he knew he was dying. He could feel the seconds ticking away on his life, inching him closer to the day that his illness – being a failure – claimed him. And he was afraid. Oh, God, he was so scared, to deteriorate, to rot. Convulsions shook his body, and just once, he could not stop himself from crying out.

"Your Highness?"

Edmund tore from his spot and killed the servant boy who had walked in, ripping his body apart with the shadows and practically bathing himself in the blood. It was glorious relief, and slowly, his mind began to clear, the fury ebbed away, and the pain receded. There was no guilt, only dark pleasure. Anything to make the pain go away. Anything to _feel_ at all.

After all, Elsa thought, unable to look away from his murderous rampage, they couldn't feel very many things. Killing was constant. It was something they could control. But for Edmund, the torturous desire to remake himself into something whole, something more – _something_ _better_ – never disappeared.

In the dead of night, Edmund returned to Baaj and stole every bit of the research left behind by Markus.

Already, the island had been ravaged by the magic of his reliquary. Just as the Southern Isles had become a frozen wasteland, Baaj became tormented by darkness, and the spirits of the dead roamed the twisted earth. Elsa saw Edmund walk into the chamber where his reliquary was held. He looked at the black stone and the small flicker of flame inside, but the sight repulsed him as much as it fascinated.

"My heart…" Edmund murmured, slowly bringing his hand up to touch the stone. Just before he reached his reliquary, he drew away. Many times he did this. Not once did he actually touch it.

It was longing and loathing both, to see that discarded, but better part of themselves. Elsa had looked at her own reliquary and longed to have it back, but loathed herself and found herself unworthy; but then she could not bear to think that, and so hated her heart, deemed it weakness. Living contradictions, the two of them. Elsa might have smiled at the irony, but she still felt her insides twist every time Edmund came close only to stop _just_ before reaching his heart.

Was there any way to reclaim the heart?

Elsa hoped there was one.

Edmund evidently decided otherwise.

Backing into the torture chambers as he departed, Edmund's gaze was drawn to one of the prison cells. There were small paper cranes lying about, and he paused, uncertain. They reminded him of someone. He ought to remember with his now perfect memory. Edmund shook his head, and instead focused on another discovery. Lying on the bed was a mask, curved, with red streaks. It was little more than an iron muzzle. Used for torture, most likely. There were thin needles inside that would pierce the face, and a bridle-bit projected into the mouth and pressed onto the tongue – so that speech was impossible.

Edmund took the mask with him.

Elsa looked over his shoulder while Edmund read by candlelight, and the indecipherable diagrams were, to him, salvation. From those writings, he learned about the reliquary, and the experiments that had been conducted. In the abandoned warehouse by the dockside, Edmund constructed his own laboratory, and he began to take victims. Slowly, one by one, people began disappearing. Edmund knew himself to be dying, and so he searched in vain for a way to prolong his life. He needed his heart back. But then, when he thought about the heart that was in Baaj, that so repulsed him, perhaps…

He only needed _a_ heart.

None could be better than the one that commanded the Mirror.

Elsa wondered if he had made his choice to take her heart simply because of that cold logic, or because he still harbored resentment. It made no difference. She watched as Edmund slaved away towards the better future that he envisioned, and she witnessed his delight when she brought Anna back from Arendelle. Here was the person who could weaken Elsa enough that her heart became vulnerable.

And then Edmund crafted the persona of the Sorcerer. Of course, he had needed to hide his identity, and the mask he procured in Baaj, for no reason which was immediately obvious to him, became useful now. He pared off the needles and tore off the mouth bridle, and the skull-mask served him well. Alvard had stumbled upon his laboratory, so Edmund seized his mind and sent him to his death. Tobias became his test subject, and he learned that he could not contain the reliquary without Anna.

"Why are you sharing this plan, and not going about this without me?" Tobias drawled.

"Are you not interested?"

"Oh, I'm very interested," Tobias said. "Though I'm just not sure there's any reason for me to believe what you're saying. See, I don't believe much in altruism. Please don't tell me you just like to share."

"Perhaps I simply believe that you are up to the task."

"…Just who are you, exactly?"

"Nobody," Edmund had said, hiding behind his mask. Except this one he could still take off, and the mask that was his face he could not. "Though I hope to become someone soon."

Everything after that no longer needed to be calculated so much, because Anna had already ingratiated herself to Elsa. Edmund was free to observe. He watched as she risked everything to get past the walls Elsa had erected, to understand her plight. He was amazed. It had been his plan, but even still, he was surprised that anyone could love Elsa, could so selflessly love someone like them, whose heart was dead.

It made him wonder if she might be able to understand him, too.

"Someone pure like you is rare," Edmund told Anna, while wearing the corpse that used to be Reid. "Which is why I wanted to meet you. Can you understand me, Anna, as you understand Elsa?"

Anna had been silent, but Edmund knew that her answer would have been…

"Yes," Elsa said. Anna would see the best in anyone. She was not so blind that she would disregard the bad; but yes, Anna could understand them. Edmund knew that too, and he admired her pure soul, began to develop a loving, jealous veneration for the faith that he could only play at…

After the warehouse collapsed, Edmund retreated back to his own body.

Gustaf was standing over him.

"What have you been doing?" Gustaf asked. He sounded like he already knew the answer somehow. He always did. Edmund hated that about him, just as much as he once loved his guidance.

"I was here," Edmund said. "You saw me just wake up."

"I should hope that you do wake up soon."

"…What does _that_ mean?"

"There was an explosion at the docks," Gustaf said, and he looked into his eyes knowingly, piercingly, so that Edmund felt like all his secrets were laid bare. "Shall we go and observe?"

"Sure," Edmund said. It would be interesting to see if Hans survived, and at any rate, Gustaf would look suspicious by going there now.

Edmund had planned all along to shift the blame to Gustaf. He had told Saul that he had a way of disappearing, and what better way than to die? If the Sorcerer died, then no one would ever know. Gustaf being the masked man was believable enough. And Edmund would make himself suspect too, because no one, not even someone as paranoid as Elsa, would suspect the same person twice. Oh, she would be so terribly mistaken about him. She would be regretful about having suspected him at all.

So Edmund followed behind.

Elsa followed too, but soon the vision had shifted to another time. She saw herself battling the Sorcerer, battling Edmund, and he was _enraged_ that she outsmarted him. Impatience had won over his sense, and he fell into a trap. But that was fine. Elsa was not resourceful enough to stop him from leaving.

Especially because she kept worrying about Anna.

It was sickening. Seeing Elsa protect another person…Elsa could not be better than him. Edmund refused to acknowledge that Elsa might be _anything_ other than the monster that he had become. Many times he could have escaped during their battle, but he stayed, and finally, he forced her to choose.

"Choose, here and now," said Edmund, hand outstretched towards Anna. "You can either protect the girl or end me here, but you cannot do both. I leave it to you, Elsa."

Elsa had chosen to attack him. Even though there was such pain in his mangled arm, and he knew he had failed, Edmund wanted to laugh. She had proved him right. He was still right. With that last thought, he succumbed to the darkness, finally allowing himself to just _die_…

…Shadows overtook him, and Edmund felt himself carried away. Bit by bit his awareness returned, as the powerful darkness – much more powerful than his own – flooded his senses. Unceremoniously, he was dumped at the chapel while the shadows reformed into the shape of a man.

"Gustaf," Edmund murmured.

"I thought you could change," Gustaf said, sounding so horribly disappointed that Edmund's eyes flew wide open. "I thought that you had only lost your way for a time, but I cannot stand by anymore."

"…Lost my way?"

Edmund laughed and laughed, tears coming to his eyes from the intensity of his mirth. And then, as abruptly as a machine grinding to a dead halt, he stopped.

"Do you think that I still care whether you approve? Who do you think you are?" Edmund hissed. Wobbling to his feet by pushing against the altar with his hand – his arm had miraculously healed _–_ Edmund spat, "You've done nothing for me."

But Gustaf had freed him from Elsa. And, Edmund noticed, given him his right arm. Gustaf was missing his right arm, while Edmund was healed–

_It…must have transferred when we were both in shadow. Why…?_

Edmund pushed the thought away, so convinced he was of his solitude. He tried his best to forget the times they shared, the times they played chess or talked through the long nights when Gustaf found him alone and unable to sleep. Yes, he was alone, and he had always been alone. What did it matter, then, that Gustaf was doing this tiny thing for him now?

"Edmund, I only wish that you stop this madness!" Gustaf reached out, and Elsa saw how hard it was for him to reach for this son that he could barely recognize anymore, but how much harder it was Edmund to pull away. "It is not too late. No one needs to know, as long as you–"

"Yes," Edmund spat, but he was so afraid that he would falter now. Never had he felt such indecision. Not since he was a child. "No one needs to know, because they will think it was you."

With one violent motion, Edmund sent his magic tearing forward. It struck Gustaf and enveloped him, burrowing its way into his body, filtering through his eyes; but while Edmund was too furious to see anything other than what he wanted to see, Elsa noticed that Gustaf's gaze remained clear. Sad, though, wearied and burdened as though he had lived for a thousand years already and the weight of eternity rested on his mind. But there was no accusation. Gustaf…blamed himself. Perhaps rightfully, Elsa thought, vindictive again, but the flash of anger passed and she felt as tired as Gustaf did.

He had tried.

His mind was always his own, even as he pretended to follow Edmund's orders and hid himself.

And then, of course, Elsa and Anna had arrived at the chapel, interrogated Edmund, and he used his magic on himself to make the appearance of a seizure. It was real, but such things had to be real to be convincing, and he threw himself in the way of an attack to protect Anna. Gustaf was felled. And Edmund, he laughed inside, he was so happy, he had pulled off his ruse perfectly–

"It was me," Gustaf said. "If you are still wary, I assure you that I am not under control. My thoughts are my own. My actions are by my own volition."

Edmund looked at him, and he realized that this man was truly, willingly, giving up his life for him. And he could not understand. Elsa clutched her head as the multitude of his thoughts invaded her own, the tumult driving through hers with battering force–

_Why is he doing this? What does he think he has to gain? He's going to die. What am I to him? He's going to die. Why would anyone be this stupid? He's going to die. Why…? He's going to die, and I will never know why. I don't understand. I don't get it. Gustaf. Gustaf is going to die. Gustaf is going to–_

"I'm so sorry, Gustaf…" Edmund murmured, even as Anna took him away, and past the pain, he wanted so desperately to stay, to apologize, to beg the forgiveness of the one person who had ever cared about him and who would _die_ now because of him. "I didn't realize…I didn't mean for this to happen…"

Elsa looked away, and this one time, the reliquary acquiesced.

As soon as Edmund recovered, Anna had gone with him to Gustaf's room.

_"Your name was Odon, but you are now Edmund and there is nothing so wrong with that. Now you know everything, but you are your own person. You can be whatever you choose to be. It was too late for me. It need not be for you."_

Edmund clutched the letter to his chest and, for the first time in fifteen years, cried tears of remorse.

"I should have seen. It's my fault!" Edmund screamed, resisting Anna's efforts to calm him. "Don't you see? Gustaf didn't need to die. All along, I should have known, I could have had more than this–!"

Happiness had always been there within reach. If he had bothered to look. If he had bothered to listen. If he had bothered, for one instant, to even consider that maybe, just maybe, there was any other path than the one he had so resolutely bound himself to – he might have been happy. But now it was all too late. Edmund wanted to throw up, because his father was dead, and he may as well have killed him with his own hands. He had _plotted_ to let his father die for him. And Gustaf, that wonderful, horrible father, had really done just that. He had died for him. He had taken his last chance of happiness to the grave.

"You can still hate what he's done." Anna gently placed her hand on Edmund's shoulder and he looked to her, despondent eyes practically pleading for an answer. She was so strong. She was so _good_, so much stronger than him that he could barely fathom how much. "You can hate that he didn't tell you. It's just like he said. You can choose. You can love him and still hate what he did, Edmund."

Edmund laughed and sobbed all at once, clutching at Anna, his lifeline. "If only I could do that, I think I would. I really think I would, Anna. I would love him. If he had told me, I would have–!"

He would have tried.

Hours after Anna left, Edmund sat alone, still clutching the letter. He had read it again and again, committing to memory not just the words but the writing, every stroke of the pen and every curve of every line. It came too late; Edmund could not bring himself to love Gustaf now. It was only a tantalizing dream that would never be realized. And anyhow he did not deserve love, whether to receive it or to give it. Edmund – the boy who had killed his own father – did not deserve happiness.

He hated Edmund.

With every fiber of his being, he hated Edmund, and he could not any longer bear to _be_ Edmund.

"Anna, I envy you so much," Edmund said aloud, staring into the darkness as the abyss stared back. "You can still have faith, because you have done nothing wrong. You are faultless. You…are perfect. If only…"

Elsa wanted to scream, but the reliquary was already pushing her away, because this was the _last_ memory that it held, because here, at this point in time, Edmund had truly discarded his heart.

_I wish I was that strong. I wish I could be like you. I don't want to be me anymore._

_I wish… I wish I was you, Anna._

* * *

Elsa awoke once more at Baaj.

She opened her eyes and could immediately see with surprising clarity. Lying right there was Edmund's reliquary, and the heart had worsened even from the time she saw it last. Soon, the corroding shell would be nothing but dust, and the flame inside would be exposed, would flicker out. It could sense its complete abandonment. It was only a matter of time now.

Part of her wished that she had never seen all of those memories. She did not _want_ to understand Edmund. Her one remaining weapon had been her cheated rage, and now even her rage had been taken away. She was left feeling empty, cold, as though she were nothing but a hollow vacuum.

Without her rage…

What did she have left now?

Elsa turned away from the darkness, and saw Olaf.

Her mouth opened in surprise, but the snowman seemed somber and unsurprised by her presence. Elsa remained motionless while Olaf wobbled to her with his tottering gait. He was not smiling anymore. Without the irregular tooth, he might have looked severe. With the tooth, he simply looked…sad.

"Olaf," Elsa said. "I thought you didn't make it."

"I'm just a snowman," Olaf said, looking her dead in the eyes, and Elsa flinched at the caustic edge in his words. "I'll always make my way back to you."

"How did you…find me?" Elsa bent down on one knee so she was at eye-level with the snowman. "Not just here. How did you find me at the Southern Isles?"

"I am just a snowman," Olaf said again, slowly.

"I-I don't understand."

Olaf said nothing, and they simply stared at one another silently, while Elsa did everything in her power to pretend that she could not sense the truth. She would have looked away if she were able. But behind those dark eyes she could sense something more, and she was drawn to that vibrancy as she had always been. Within the shell of snow, there was a pulse.

"Anna gave it to you when we built you that day," Elsa said.

Olaf was holding her heart.

Olaf _was_ her reliquary.

"I wondered if you would recognize me," Olaf said.

"Did you doubt that I would?" Elsa shook her head. She felt her mouth dry, but she could not contain the urge to keep talking, to explain. "Of course I'll recognize you, I can feel my heart right there–"

"Well, I just wasn't sure if you would _want_ to recognize me."

Elsa shut her mouth.

Olaf turned his attention to the reliquary – the _other_ reliquary – resting on its plinth less than five feet away. His eyes stared unblinkingly at the sacrifice for a moment, and then he lowered his head. His whole body slumped, leaving him looking so reduced that he seemed a foreign creature altogether.

"Did you see everything that it had to show you?"

"Yes," Elsa said.

"And did you…have any thoughts about that?"

Elsa shook her head mutely.

"Nothing?" Olaf asked again. "Are you sure there was nothing at all?"

"I'm not like him," Elsa choked, "I'm nothing like him."

Olaf raised his head, and for a moment there was a deep, deep sadness in his eyes; but the black began to glow, and the piercing blue light that emerged was gloriously bright. She could barely see the snowman anymore, but she could make out the shell of snow falling away, revealing for an instant the brilliant shard of her heart. It was so bright that Elsa had to shut her eyes – and then she felt a warm hand grasp the front of her shirt and pull her close, and her eyes flew open again.

She was looking into her own face.

Her face as a child, except those eyes were aged beyond their time, and there was something horribly wrong about seeing deadened eyes on an innocent face. Elsa stilled under the force of her burning gaze. She wanted to die rather than be judged by that gaze, pitiless, condemning.

"I hate you," said the Other-Elsa.

"I know," Elsa whispered.

"Don't tell me you know! You don't know anything. You'll _never_ know." Slowly, her voice had become a hiss, but now the Other-Elsa snarled. "You cut me out and locked me away in the dark."

"I-It wasn't like that," Elsa said, but her younger self responded only with a cutting laugh. "I didn't have a choice, I _needed_ to, I wouldn't have been able to go on unless–"

"Unless you reduced yourself to a wraith?"

Elsa would have looked away if she could, but she was drawn to that betrayed gaze as though she wanted to be judged.

"It's just an excuse. It's an easy out that you can hide yourself behind," said the Other-Elsa. "It makes me sick to even look at you. Being reminded that I used to be a part of _you_…!" Another laugh, but her younger self was not smiling. She jerked her head toward the other reliquary. "How many excuses can you make before you take a good look at yourself?"

"I'm nothing like him," Elsa said again, following the Other's gaze to the corrupted, corroding heart that lay so close. "I _want_ to be whole again, I _want_ my heart back–"

"_For – what – reason!"_

Elsa stilled, and her younger self stared at her with triumph. She had barely raised her voice, and yet, still, her voice rang in her mind and carried through her entire being. There were no more words. Elsa had nothing left to defend herself from these faults, because she _knew_ that the Other was right.

"For Anna," said the Other-Elsa.

"…Yes," Elsa said.

"Never for your own sake. Never for _my_ sake," said the Other-Elsa, her strong voiced reduced to little more than a whisper, and it was utterly broken.

Unbidden, Elsa turned her gaze to Edmund's reliquary. No more use in denying the truth. She was so much like him. She had done the same things. All the same things. Perhaps not to the same extent, but she had wanted to somehow remake herself so she would be like Anna. She had no other reason for wanting her heart back. She hated how wretched her existence had become, just as Edmund did, and she thought that, maybe, she could learn to be like Anna. It was always about Anna. Not her own sake.

"But you know that my memories were changed," Elsa said weakly. "I was tricked, I wouldn't have given up my heart otherwise. I know I was wrong, but–"

"Who else do you have to blame? You _abandoned_ me. You were the one to throw me away, not anyone else!" Elsa stood stunned, but the Other no longer seemed to derive any pleasure from her pain. She was crying. Elsa stayed still while the Other beat her tiny fists against her chest, sobbing. "What do you have to be so afraid of that you would…throw…me…away?"

Elsa said nothing, and the Other-Elsa faltered. Her every blow was weak, half-hearted, until finally she simply collapsed into her arms. Elsa could feel her pitifully small frame shaking with the force of her sobs, and she unconsciously tightened her hold. In response, the child clutched onto her arms like she was drowning, and Elsa was her only lifeline. It may well have been true.

"I'm sorry," Elsa whispered.

"…I know," said the Other-Elsa. "But I _refuse_ to be part of someone whose only purpose is to try to be another person. If you have no more need of me, then I would rather destroy myself and have us both rot. Anything is better than living another lie. It would be the best for me…and for you."

Was this to be her end, rejected by the heart that she had once abandoned?

"I understand," Elsa said.

"…Are you just giving up, then?"

"I'm not giving up," Elsa said, and she drew away, keeping her hands on the Other's shoulders, so that she could look into her eyes, _their_ eyes. "I understand that I might not be worthy of my heart anymore, but I – I'm willing to try. Please give me another chance."

Now it was the Other's turn to search her eyes, searching for any glimpse of dishonesty, any hint of deception. But she had never needed to look. She could feel anything and everything that she felt. After all, Elsa knew, this was still her heart. After a very long moment, the Other-Elsa nodded.

"Why do you want to try?"

"I-I want to be whole again. I know what I'm missing."

"Still the same. Still wanting things, and not knowing why–"

"No!" Elsa surprised herself with the conviction in her voice, and perhaps the Other, too. She quieted and stared at her with wide eyes. "I-I know. I know why I did what I did – I was hurt, I made myself vulnerable and I was hurt, and, and I – I didn't want to be hurt again. I needed certainty. I needed to know that I would never even have the _chance_ to hurt again."

"So why…do you want that back?"

"Because I know I can't ever have total certainty," Elsa said, and just _saying_ that made her feel lighter, somehow. She had never realized how very weighed down she had become. "You asked me what I was afraid of, and I can tell you now – I can admit – I was afraid of pain, and hurt, and rejection. I thought I could lock myself away and become _better_ than other people, and I wouldn't even need their approval. I thought I could harden myself so that I would never be vulnerable again."

"…It was the easier way, I know."

"It was," Elsa agreed. "And I really thought I was happy like that, for a while, because – I was so detached from everything that I couldn't feel _anything_ anymore. I couldn't feel the _pain_ anymore."

"What's changed?" asked the Other-Elsa, desperately, so desperately and so full of reluctant hope that there were once again tears in her eyes; and Elsa knew that, once, she would have found this to be the most detestable weakness, that she should _never_ cry again. She would have wanted nothing to do with this child. She would have done everything – she _had_ done everything – to rid herself of this weakness.

Elsa took a deep breath.

"Nothing has changed. Nothing will make the world certain, but I – I can accept that now. Or at least, I want to try. I want the chance to be _myself_ again, not anyone else…and not for anyone else. It might be hard to have to feel again and bear the pain, but it's _my_ pain, and that pain…makes me who I am."

She was stumbling over her words. There was so much more that she wanted to say, but this would have to suffice. They were long past the point of words; Elsa waited, and this time, the Other-Elsa was just as lost. She remained silent while she read past the words, into the bond that had always been there. Finally, she swallowed and nodded again. There was just a hint of a smile on her face, but Elsa could no longer be sure. Light flooded her senses, and she could only hear one last sentence, one last question that her heart needed answered.

"…Are you still afraid?"

But they already knew the answer.

Before her eyes, the form of the little girl dissolved into the most beautiful glow she had ever seen, made of light upon water, of poetry. And Elsa accepted the warmth of its touch, closing her eyes, fully allowing herself to feel this radiance. It was like the breeze whispering over her skin, the touch of summer relieving her of the long winter she had endured. She felt the soft warmth pass through her body, and she was born anew. All the hollow pain that tormented her for so long was finally assuaged. Her senses, which had been so dulled, flared into existence, so that the world became so much fuller, so much more complete. She had feared this before. She knew she had. Being whole again, being vulnerable, she had thought that was weakness. Every moment of her life, she had feared.

Elsa opened her eyes.

"I'm not afraid."

Anna stood high above. Where the winds were at their strongest and the storm raged without mercy, she stood motionless, clad only in a simple white doublet. Her attention was elsewhere. Even as her eyes traced its clear surface, the Mirror glowed with swoops and whirls of blazing light, but…

Something was not quite right, and Anna was very amused to learn the reason.

There was a missing piece.

Anna had not noticed until now, too enraptured by the rush of triumph, but her heart – and the center of the Mirror – was fragmented at its core. It seemed almost unthinkable that she would be so neglectful, but it was only the smallest of fragments, barely a sliver missing from the snowflake heart. Even without the shard, the Mirror was already functional, and had responded to her desire. It would only take a little longer to activate and finish the momentous task.

Though perhaps she would have the chance to reclaim the last piece soon enough.

Anna could sense Elsa approaching.

She grinned even as her fingers traced the small schism, because Elsa was the only person that could make her feel so alive. Elsa was the only thing worth waking and living and dying. She had become weak, but now she was strong again, and Anna felt exhilaration at the thought that they would meet again. Oh, how she would treasure this meeting! Since Anna had been reborn, Elsa was all that had been in her mind. It had always been Elsa dominating her every thought. She _loved_ Elsa so much.

Anna stepped into gleaming silver boots, allowing magic to finish the ensemble. Greaves buckled to her legs. Gauntlets slid onto her hands, completed by the additional vambrace. Over her torso, an ornate cuirass snapped into place, followed by faulds that fell over her hips. Anna pinned the dark flowing cape to her shoulders personally, lowered the tiara of her royal office onto her head, and took a long second to admire her reflection. More of her hair had whitened, but that was fine.

She was dressed for war now.

Because soon she would face her legendary foe, her eternal rival, her only equal, and she would savor every moment of this end. It would be a fitting finale between them. Until that moment, she had not yet lived, and after that climax, after reaching that sublime peak of perfection, she would end the world. Everything would end while she was still perfect. She would never deteriorate, never decline.

She would freeze the entire world.

_"I shall not die alone, alone, but kin to all the powers,_

_As merry as the ancient sun and fighting like the flowers._

_How white their steel, how bright their eyes! I love each laughing knave,_

_Cry high and bid him welcome to the banquet of the brave._

_Yea, I will bless them as they bend and love them where they lie,_

_When on their skulls the sword I swing falls shattering from the sky._

_The hour when death is like a light and blood is like a rose –_

_You never loved your friends, my friends, as I shall love my foes."_

Anna closed her eyes, and she waited for the end.

**a/n:** Now, I know I said I wouldn't have any more notes until the story's end, but close enough. After all, this is the second to last chapter! And today is the one-year anniversary of Tempest. One year ago, I started this story, and now, there's just one chapter left. Thank you again for being on this journey. I hope that you will find the ending a satisfying one, though it may not necessarily be what you all may want. It might be, though, but remember that not all good endings are happy :)
