**Chapter 37: Acquainted With the Night**

Elsa staggered towards the Southern Isles Castle.

Alone.

She had never realized how foreboding the castle appeared. Years and years ago, when Elsa first saw the castle looming in the distance, so tall and so grand, she had been awed. Now, as she stood outside and stared up at the formation of towers, all jagged lines and pointed spires, she saw none of that previous majesty. Grey stone appeared no less impersonal for the pane of diamond-sheened ice lying atop its dull countenance. Even the finest art would be lost on its single-minded, militaristic design.

It was a fortress.

Elsa stepped inside, eyes closing as the doors slammed shut behind her.

Barely a moment had passed, and she was reminded how life had been before Anna. Not just cold but barren, solitude and closed doors. She was surrounded by silence and falsities, until her own voice became a foreign sound to her ears, and her face unrecognizable in the mirror. But back then, she could still pretend this castle was home. She hardly knew any other life to be had.

Now she remembered what she was missing.

Upon her arrival at the docks, the other inhabitants of the castle had likely been alerted by sentries; Elsa heard footsteps coming from the princes' wing. She straightened her back and forced her hand away from the wound in her side just as an unlikely pair arrived – Alek and Saul both came through the side door, Saul carrying a medical briefcase. Alek had a rare smile on his face, but not long after seeing Elsa, his lips turned into their usual scowl.

"Where's Anna?" Alek asked.

Elsa felt a laugh catch in her throat, some strangled thing desperate to claw its way out. Instead she fixed Alek with a frigid stare, and in a tone that brokered no argument, said, "She will not be returning."

"…What?" When Alek made to move forward, Saul placed a hand over his shoulder and held him back; but his gaze never left Elsa. Even while his younger brother struggled to break free, Saul kept his eyes trained on her, searching her face, and Elsa returned his gaze without breaking contact.

"Calm down," Saul said offhandedly.

"Don't tell me to calm down." Alek shrugged off Saul's hold and demanded, "Why? Anna told me she would be coming back. What happened?"

"Nothing," Elsa said. She didn't know why she kept having to resist the urge to laugh, but it was so very, very true that she had done nothing, and it was so very, very funny. "I thought you would be pleased."

Alek furrowed his brow. "Pleased?"

"You were the one who condemned me for holding her against her will," Elsa said. "Do you enjoy her company so much that you've forgotten all about it?"

"It's not – I was wrong," Alek said. "She wanted to be here."

Another time, Elsa might have enjoyed the contrite look on his face. Right then, she wanted to cave in that face so he would never speak again, never say those things that pained her once more.

"As it turns out, you were right. Anna has chosen to remain in Arendelle," Elsa said. She looked away from the brothers, suddenly beset by a bone-deep weariness at her own admission. "Spread the word to the others. And Saul, come with me."

Alek seemed too shocked to argue, and Elsa took advantage of his momentary silence to start up the stairs. Saul followed, and together they ascended the staircase to her wing of the castle. It was a short walk, but telling. Usually, Saul would have kept pace two steps behind in deference. Just this once, Elsa noticed him struggling to keep his distance, overstepping and readjusting again and again.

Once they'd arrived at her office, Saul asked, "What do you require, Queen Elsa?"

Elsa sat at her sofa rather than the chair of her raised desk, but if Saul was startled by her choice, he hid his surprise well. "Since you seem to be well prepared already," Elsa said, nodding at his briefcase, "I require medical assistance."

Hours after her escape, her body had equilibrated and become tolerant to the poison. Hemlock, she assumed, and at such a concentration that it became fast-acting, but the poison wasn't the problem. As soon as her powers returned, her magic continuously attempted to heal the arrow wound – disregarding the growing infection. For the days-long voyage, the gash had forcibly sutured and torn apart, again and again. Elsa tore off the bodice of her dress, revealing the half-healed wound in her side.

It was now a mass of gangrenous flesh stretching nearly eight inches across, from her stomach around her waist and to her back. Mottled red and yellow, at the center of her inflamed skin lay the pulsing wound, oozing a mixture of blood and infectious discharge.

"I promise there won't even be a mark left behind," Saul murmured.

"Is that even possible?"

"I'll need to excise the flesh before you can heal properly," Saul said, kneeling at her side and opening his briefcase, withdrawing materials that Elsa had no interest in seeing. "But I may not be able to. Not when your automatic defense will stop me from approaching–"

"I can control that now," Elsa said.

"You realize, then, that you have to be awake, and there are no painkillers strong enough to affect you." Saul looked up and stretched out his hand, as though to touch her face. Elsa turned her head, and Saul instead reached up to tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear.

"There's no pain that I can't handle." Elsa was beginning to find physical pain a thankful relief. It was a reminder that she was alive. She could still feel _that_ at least. After everything, she doubted, sometimes, whether or not she could be considered such while living her half-life bereft of nearly all other sensation.

"I'll begin, then."

Disinfectant was molten lava being poured over her flesh, but Elsa silently bore the pain and watched part of the diseased skin slough away. Saul laid a hand over her bare stomach, scalpel glinting in his other. When the blade dug into her side and sliced apart her flesh, she clenched her jaw and continued to watch. She refused to close her eyes. She refused to utter any sound. She _would_ remember this.

Each gash was another reminder of her weakness.

"What happened?" Saul asked. When Elsa stayed silent, he added, "Talking may help to distract you."

"Agdar had planned an assassination," Elsa bit out. It didn't distract her at all. If anything, the pain seemed worse. It just didn't come from her side. "But you seemed prepared for my return."

"I was checking up on Hans, conveniently enough."

It _was_ convenient.

But Elsa noticed that Saul wasn't denying being prepared.

Soon after, the pain ended. Saul began wrapping the cleaned wound with bandages, and Elsa could feel the difference already. Without infection hampering her healing, her magic was quick at work repairing the damage. Cold had numbed the pain from fire to a dull ache, and it would pass soon enough. When Saul stood up and leaned closer to reach around her waist, Elsa seized his collar and dragged him closer. Only inches away, she could count each of his individual eyelashes. Still Saul was not perturbed.

"Why did you do it?" Elsa murmured.

Saul looked down to her hands for a moment before meeting her eyes. "I'm not sure I understand what you mean." Despite his words, the electric-blue staring back at her already told Elsa what she needed to know. "You'll have to be clearer if you're accusing me of something, Your Majesty."

"Agdar said Anna had written him a letter detailing my weaknesses. Not many people know how my powers work," Elsa said. Not that her ice was any secret, but the mechanics behind it all, the automatic defense, the lightning – Elsa could count on one hand the number of people who knew. "And of them, Anna would never be able to deduce my weaknesses so flawlessly."

"You're right," Saul agreed. "Quite frankly, she's too simple-minded."

"And only one person would know how to poison me." Elsa watched as the corner of Saul's lips turned in quiet satisfaction. "After years of monitoring my health."

"It was me," Saul admitted. "I sent Agdar that letter, but in Anna's handwriting."

"You had to know I would realize it was you."

"Yes."

"And you weren't afraid I would kill you when I returned? Or did you hope I would die?"

Saul said nothing, and for a time there they remained, both of them teetering on the edge of decision, their silence full of unspoken words. Though she was the one holding him by the throat, Elsa had the odd feeling she was the one least in control. At last, Elsa released his collar. Saul finished wrapping her wound and drew away, but remained kneeling before her, waiting for sentencing.

"You are so far above them that they couldn't have succeeded."

"Close enough."

"Only because you were distracted."

"So what was the point?"

"I needed to show you something you already knew," Saul said, and he tentatively reached out. Elsa didn't move away when he took her hand. "Anna wouldn't choose you. She's not one of us. She can never fully be yours, but… Elsa, I can be there for you instead. I always have been."

"You would just be her replacement. Is that really what you want?"

"Yes," Saul said, voice breathy with religious rapture, sounding so desperately hopeful that it must have been absolute despair to bottle it inside all these years. "I don't mind. I just want to be with you."

Saul brought her hand to his cheek, looking into her eyes all the while. His soft, unguarded smile was the same one he had born when they were younger, and Elsa remembered the days spent with that bright-eyed, polite boy, the one who smuggled her chocolates in between etiquette lessons and found time to tutor her outside his own classes. His skin was warm, Elsa thought. Like Anna.

"If you really don't mind," Elsa said, releasing just enough cold from her palm that Saul flinched away, "I can tell you, for certain, that you never loved me."

"That's not true."

"If you did, you wouldn't be content as a replacement."

Elsa watched his facade melt away. For a brief instant, the innocence of the boy twisted into something harsh, something ugly, before Saul managed to control his emotions and smoothed his features into an uneasy calm. But it wasn't meant to be duplicitous. Elsa knew Saul long enough, well enough, to understand his guise was simply who he had become. Saul had always worn his masks well.

"Was Anna not a replacement for me?" Saul asked. "She only intrigued you because she didn't fear you. But before her, I was always there, I never feared–"

"It's not just that."

"Tell me then. She was nothing but a stupid little girl who didn't know a thing about you. She didn't deserve you." Saul shook his head. "And look how she repaid you. She didn't choose you, Elsa."

"You're right. She didn't understand me, not the way either of us thought," Elsa said. She turned away, eyes closing against her will. "Leave, Saul. You've made your point already."

"Not enough. Why can't you see?"

"I believe I told you to leave."

Outside, the storm that had passed began to rage once more. Hail struck the windows with such violence that the glass rattled, and the gales swept the snow into furious tumult, obscuring all else with a veil of white. Even the sun had been blocked out by stormclouds. Not the barest whisper of light passed through. Elsa dug her fingers into the leather of the couch, and despite her wishes, ice crept over the alabaster upholstery.

"I need you to understand that difference, Elsa, I would always, _always_ choose–"

"Would it really be for me?" Elsa spun around and snatched Saul's collar again. "Do you know why I chose Anna? She may not have understood, but she loved me, for no reason but that I'm…Elsa."

Saul widened his eyes when Elsa drew closer.

She pressed their lips together.

It hadn't been something she understood or even realized until she had Anna to compare, but Saul had always looked at her and yet never seen her at all. She didn't think less of him for it. She still remembered the first time he laid eyes on her, and she believed that Saul _had_, for that moment, loved. But once she became more than just the scared girl, once she became useful and of worth, that was all she could ever be in his eyes, in anyone's eyes; and Elsa, also, looked at others and saw inferiority.

She had to be superior, because if not, no one would spare her a second glance.

Until she met Anna, and for once someone saw her too.

And that was why she loved Anna.

And that was why Saul _thought_ he loved her, because he could pretend to love, because he wanted to fool himself with a dream of romance. She understood. She could hardly hate him for dreaming.

Elsa wasn't surprised when Saul didn't respond to her kiss. Both of them were cold. She pulled away and Saul looked elsewhere, anywhere but at her, looking so numb that Elsa thought he understood.

"Could you feel anything?" Elsa asked, knowing the answer.

"I proved my point, and you proved yours," Saul said. Rising from the floor, he collected all his supplies and shoved them into his briefcase, fumbling with the clasps as he never did.

"You're not like her after all," Elsa murmured.

"I'm sorry that I'm not." Saul walked to the door, but halfway through twisting the knob he stopped, fingers tapping the brass handle, and he looked back. "Did you…know how she would choose?"

"Yes," Elsa said. She had always known. She had only needed to hear it from Anna. "We had gone as far as we could go together. Right now…our paths are different."

"With time, that might change."

"I thought you didn't approve."

"I need to believe that _our_ paths can change as well." Saul smiled. Some of his old confidence had returned, the quiet poise so superior to pomp, so much more secure. "Neither Anna nor I know how, but we're on equal ground now; I'll learn how to love you again. One day, I can be selfless for you."

Elsa didn't smile now but she _knew_ that she would have, once.

"Even if you do, I can't promise anything."

"Let me hope," Saul said, and Elsa nodded her head. She could give him that. "It may be worthless, coming from me, but I'm sorry things had to turn out this way, for you and Anna."

"I don't blame you. I told you, I knew."

_But I hoped she would choose me anyway._

Saul left, and she was left to her thoughts. She was so tired. Elsa leaned back, but sleep would never come. Her sleepless nights would return now. She closed her eyes but all she could see was Anna, the memory of their last minutes together seared into the back of her eyelids. In those last moments, she realized Anna no longer held her reliquary. Living that memory again with her perfect recall, she saw the missing white streak in Anna's hair. She didn't know where the shard of her heart could have gone. Maybe it had finally crumbled to nothing, Elsa thought. Just like Gustaf predicted.

She laughed, and sobbed.

Anna couldn't feel what she felt anymore.

_Does this mean I'll be the only one who hurts now?_

* * *

"Anna, I-I'm going to leave your dinner outside. Make sure you eat something. Please."

Anna heard her father's footsteps leading away from the door, but she didn't budge. She sat against the headboard of her bed with her knees drawn in, staring at the opposite wall. For three days, she had remained like this. Olaf crawled out from under her bed and ambled to the door, peeking under the crack to make sure no one was around. Anna watched out the corner of her eye to make sure nothing happened when he opened the door and grabbed the plate her father had left.

"Hey, Anna!" Olaf said, shuffling over to the bed and reaching up over his head to slide the plate near her side. Anna peered over the edge and looked at his earnest smile. "You're going to like this stuff."

"Not hungry, Olaf."

She already ate earlier at his behest. When Agdar left lunch behind, Olaf had bothered her enough to take a few bites. It was always her favorite, and always bland and tasted like ash on her tongue.

"But you have to stay strong, and you can't do that hungry," Olaf said. Grabbing onto the blankets, he pulled himself up and shimmied onto the bed.

"I just don't have an appetite right now. I'll eat later."

"Okay, but when's later?"

"Tomorrow."

"But that's what you said yesterday, and you said you weren't hungry earlier either…"

Sometimes Anna wished she could throw Olaf out. She wanted silence more than anything, but the snowman almost never stopped pestering her about eating, or getting up and walking, or going out for some sun. Sometimes Anna wished Olaf had never been built at all. Looking at him only reminded her of Elsa. Now that she was back at home, alone, the past six months almost felt like a dream. Almost, because Olaf was irrefutable proof of what was now lost.

But when those moments of vindictiveness passed, she inevitably ended up feeling guilty.

Anna scooped up a bite and forced herself to eat, each bite, each rise and fall of her jaw, feeling like a mechanical motion. She swallowed, and she felt ash scraping down her throat. She had to be imagining it, but even her stomach churned, long before the food could have gone that far.

"How are you feeling?" Olaf asked.

"Like I want to sleep and never wake up," Anna said, and she remembered what Elsa had promised, that she would be there when she woke from her dreams. No point waking now. All their promises, gone.

"Oh." Olaf faltered for only a moment before he perked up again. "Well, that's all right. It hasn't even been long since what happened. Once you get outta this slump, you can–"

"Why do you always say that? I have to stay strong, I have to get out of this slump." Anna drew her blankets closer, ignoring the plate falling with a clang, spilling its contents on the carpet.

"It's not over!"

"What's not over?"

"Elsa! You still love her," Olaf said.

Anna jerked away, the sudden movement sending Olaf flying off the bed. When she saw what she had done, she opened her mouth to apologize – and then closed it again, turning away from the snowman and clutching her blankets tight. She could feel her fingernails pressing through the fabric to bite into her palm. She could hardly breathe. Anna curled inwards and shut her eyes, willing her thoughts to stray far, far away from Elsa. She couldn't think about her, not without hurting all over again.

"She's hurting too," Olaf said.

"Not right now, Olaf," Anna breathed. Without thinking, her fingers threaded through where the white strand had once been. "Not now. Please, just leave me alone."

"I can feel it even from here."

"Go. Away. Please."

It was too late to stop thinking of her, not when she finally started going down that road after three days of careful repression. Elsa didn't hurt at all, Anna thought, not like she did. Bitterness rose like tar caught in her throat, thick and viscous, too much to ever vocalize. Part of her _hated_ what Elsa had done, Anna realized. Always, Elsa found ways to push her away. Did Elsa have any right to be upset? Elsa had been the one to force her into that unfair choice. Elsa had been the one to make her choose.

"How did she expect me to let Pappa die?" Anna bit out.

"I don't think she did."

"Really?" She still remembered steel pointed at her throat, but she also remembered gentle fingers tracing her face with loving care. She still remembered the harsh, guttural voice, but she also heard whispered promises and the sound of music. "So why did she leave when I didn't let her kill him?"

"You really _don't_ understand," Olaf murmured.

She didn't need reminding.

"Shut up! Nobody wants you here, Olaf!"

After the shout escaped her lips, Anna was left heaving dry breaths while the reverberations died out. She couldn't recognize her own voice. She wasn't supposed to be like that. What happened? When did she become so hateful? She had been someone would never have turned anyone away, not when they needed her, not even if she didn't know for what purpose. She wanted to be that person again.

Anna turned around. Olaf was sitting on his haunches, frozen in quiet dismay more hopeless than Anna thought his features capable of expressing. And Olaf wasn't moving. In fact, he was completely static. Anna leapt out of bed and raced over to the snowman, feeling her own heart stop at the thought that this last remnant of Elsa might be gone. Olaf had closed his eyes. It was as though every bit of magic had been drained out of him.

"Olaf?" Anna reached out, but her shaking hand paused an inch away from the snowman. "Olaf, please, I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. What don't I understand?"

Nothing.

She was truly alone now.

* * *

With lightning coursing all around her body, Elsa felt invincible.

She was pushing harder than she had ever pushed before, pushing until she could practically feel _heat_ rather than cold, until every angry surge of electricity screeched so loudly she could hear nothing else. Shards of ice levitated off the ground and surrounded her on all sides, interlaced by bolts of lightning to form an impenetrable web. Her magic had never been stronger.

Or she would have thought so once.

Elsa released her hold on the barrier, and the lightning dissipated, the ice shattered. Instantly the pressure on her body alleviated. She felt so much lighter that she marveled she had ever been reckless enough to throw all her power forward without restraint. Before, the sheer weight of her magic had been shackling her to the ground. Even her vision cleared without white-hot rage clouding her thoughts.

"I really did become overconfident," Elsa murmured.

She remembered how easily the Sorcerer had outmaneuvered her at every turn. It had been sheer power that allowed her to win, nothing more. Elsa knew herself to have been more mobile, more instinctive in her movements when she was younger. Before the reliquary, she had such a wide range of options. She had allowed herself to think the brute force masking her slipping control was power.

Which was why she was now practicing with a sword instead.

"It's a little weird to see you using that instead of, you know, _pew pew pew_, magical powers."

Elsa turned around and Edmund was there, looking on with a curious tilt of his head.

"It's best to be well-rounded," Elsa said. She crushed the ice-sword in her hand and let the pieces crumble to the ground to join the snow. "In all things, I think."

"Yeah, I guess." Edmund adjusted his scarf, but he made no move to get back inside, seemingly content to stay out in the cold to talk. "Would be nice if I was just really, really good at one thing, though."

Elsa could think of nothing to say. Vaguely realizing that she hadn't spoken to Edmund since the mishap with Gustaf, Elsa remembered only threatening the boy's life and being witness to his almost-death.

"Are you not cold?" Elsa asked.

"Kinda got used to this a few years back."

"Ahh. Yes."

"We should really talk more often," Edmund said, laughing as he pointed to the courtyard fountain. Without waiting, he swept aside the snow and plopped himself down on the edge.

"Maybe." Elsa hesitated for a moment before claiming a seat next to him, moving the snow with a gentle flick of her fingers. "I'm afraid I'm not a great conversationalist."

"It gets easier the more you talk."

Elsa hummed her agreement. Lacing her fingers together in her lap, she looked towards Edmund but really directed her gaze outwards to the renewed winter storm. Nothing she attempted had been able to quell the buffeting wind. "I apologize about what happened before."

"What happened…before?"

"I mistook you for the Sorcerer, and I threatened your life," Elsa said.

"Well, you weren't wrong to suspect me," Edmund said, snorting. "Nothing to be sorry about, really."

"And I'm sorry that Gustaf had to die."

Edmund shuddered, right hand closing into a tight fist, and even his breathing stopped. Elsa watched as he exhaled, eyes closing, and his hand unclenched so slowly that it seemed to take immense effort. When Edmund opened his eyes, even Elsa could tell the smile he plastered onto his face was false.

"It had to happen, I guess."

"You two were close," Elsa said, feeling, for some reason, an inexplicable need to apologize, to make amends. "And I was the one to take that away–"

"No," Edmund said, voice harshening for a moment with something that Elsa could identify with, something she knew intimately. Guilt, Elsa thought. Regret. Edmund shook his head. "It wasn't you."

"But for whatever my words are worth, I _am_ sorry."

"Your words are worth a lot to me, Sis." Edmund smiled softly now, but the smaller expression was more genuine than the horribly forced smile from before. "Can I still call you that?"

"If you'd like."

Both of them sat quietly at the fountain, lost in their own thoughts. Elsa stretched out her hand and caught a snowflake, though it stayed in her palm for only a second before the wind picked it up again and carried it away. Maybe it could fly across the sea and reach Arendelle, Elsa thought, and Anna would see it and think of her. Would they be fond memories? Or had even the happiest recollections soured? Edmund cleared his throat, and Elsa turned to see him watching with a knowing look in his eyes.

"I know that none of us are supposed to talk about her, but do you miss Anna?"

"All the time."

Not a moment passed that she didn't think about Anna. Some things, some people_,_ would never be forgotten no matter how much time passed, and scarcely a week had passed, not enough time to even make a pretense of healing. Her physical wound might have closed, but inside, where Anna had been torn away, that wound was still torn and raw.

"Why did you let her go?" Edmund asked.

"I asked too much of her, and Anna is too selfless," Elsa said. She knew herself to be flawed. Not just missing her heart, but something else too, something she had lost when she made that decision to be inhuman. Identity. She barely understood who she _was_ anymore.

When Anna had offered to be her heart, Elsa had already known, deep down, that they were doomed to failure. Anna was her own person. She couldn't be her heart. But Anna would have been willing to make herself into everything she ever needed, Anna would give up her own happiness so _she_ could be happy, and Elsa refused to be that selfish. She was responsible for destroying herself. She couldn't let Anna do the same thing for her sake.

"Anna _is_ that way. She's strong," Edmund said, scuffling the snow with his boots. "Speaking honestly, I wish…I was that strong. I want to be like Anna. Is that how you feel too, Sis?"

"Yes."

"What's stopping you?"

"I don't know myself as well as I should," Elsa admitted. She was the one with magic, but still she felt so weak in comparison to Anna. Anna had beliefs. She believed in herself and in goodness, in faith, with unshakable confidence. And there was her, toiling in the darkness without purpose, without feeling.

"Isn't there anyone that does?"

Elsa stiffened.

Just one person might.

"Well, I guess I should get back inside. Hopefully you get all this figured out, Sis." Edmund rose and brushed off his pants, waving his goodbye, but Elsa barely managed to nod. She waited until he was safely within the castle before she spun around to look in the opposite direction.

Just one person might be able to help her now. She needed her heart back. She needed to feel again so she could know who she was, know what to do, so she could love Anna without burdening her.

Elsa looked towards the Tower.

It was time to wake Markus.
