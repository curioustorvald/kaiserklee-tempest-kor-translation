**Chapter 34: Flower in the Mirror, Moon on the Water**

"So, I was thinking…" Anna fidgeted and stared out into the night sky where, just on the edge of the horizon, appearing almost like a mirage, Arendelle was visible.

Home. After so long, seeing the castle even from afar brought such a swell of fulfillment that Anna hadn't been able to vocalize her joy. She thought she would cheer and scream. Instead she stood there, numb, with one hand clapped against her mouth, trying to hold back tears of joy welling in her eyes. She had always missed Arendelle, but until right then, seeing her home within reach, did she realize how much. It was like an ache that had never faded. Nothing could have described the elation she felt.

Elsa had stopped the ship so Anna could compose herself, and looking at Arendelle from a distance was rather calming. It was a new experience unlike anything she had done before, actually. Being in the heart of her kingdom amidst the bustle of the people was great, being swept up in the cheer and feeling the excitement of their daily rough and tumble was great, but Anna had never taken a moment to see all of Arendelle like she was doing now. Maybe she had been around Elsa too much and she was thinking way too much about things. It was just…different. But a good different. Maybe she had grown up a bit.

And then that had led to some consideration about the _manner_ of her return.

"My ship might draw unnecessary attention," Elsa admitted.

"Kinda hard not to notice," Anna said. People might not be able to recognize Elsa herself, but she doubted Arendelle had forgotten the sole ship that had conquered the entire kingdom. Trying her hardest not to wince, she added, "People might not be too happy if they knew who you were, so…"

"Fortunately, we arrived at night. I can double around to the outskirts."

Staying close to the mountainside, they drifted toward the unpopulated edge of town where the beaches were, weaving through rocky crags to stay out of sight. Elsa docked as close as possible, but the shallow waters meant she had to stay a small distance from the beach. It was already lucky the ship didn't need an anchor, so she could hide it inside a convenient arch. Elsa formed a bridge of ice over the water for Anna to cross.

"And now we can have a proper relationship, starting with a long walk on the beach," Anna said, grinning when Elsa let out a small snort.

It really was nice out though. Picturesque, even, with the crescent moon shining above them on a cloudless, starry night. Gentle waves lapped at the shores, bringing with it a thin layer of foamy seawater. Anna took off her shoes and wiggled her toes in the sand, relishing the warmth.

"What are you doing?" Elsa asked.

"You have to walk barefoot. It's the best!" Anna burrowed her foot under the sand and kicked up a plume, watching it billow in the wind. "Oh, and you're wearing heels of all things. Just try!"

"I'll pass," Elsa muttered, eyeing the muddy sand with distaste.

Anna stuck out her tongue. "You're no fun."

She took Elsa's hand and led them on a slow walk back to town, standing closer to the shore while Elsa walked along the dryer sand. Neither of them said anything, instead listening to the crashing of the waves. It was a nice, comfortable silence between them now, not the pregnant pause that was so much more common as of late. Anna smiled down at her feet, watching the waves bathe her feet.

"Why are you smiling to yourself?" Elsa asked, but she was smiling too.

"I'm just really happy. I keep feeling like I'm dreaming. Maybe I _am_ dreaming," Anna said. "Is it really cliché if I say I don't ever want to wake up?"

"Yes. Stupid too," Elsa said. "Of course you should wake up. I'll be there when you do."

"I don't know if that was really mean or really smooth," Anna laughed. "All right, I think that proves I'm not dreaming. Pretty sure I wouldn't dream you saying something like _that_."

"…Is that bad?"

"No, I'd rather have the real you than some version I dreamed," Anna said. Standing on tiptoes, she reached up to peck Elsa on the cheek. "You're better than anything I could have imagined."

"Anna..."

"I'm serious, I wouldn't change anything about you. I know you worry about making me happy or whatever, but you already do," Anna said. She tightened her grip and felt Elsa squeeze back, the pressure of their interlaced fingers grounding them both. "I love you. I'll always love you."

"…Thank you," Elsa said. Anna yelped when she stopped and pulled her closer, but her complaints were quieted when Elsa touched her forehead to hers. "Anna, I…"

Elsa quieted, and Anna knew she was having difficulty saying those three words. It wasn't that Elsa didn't feel the same way; Anna could _feel_ everything Elsa felt for her through the warm pulse that connected their hearts. She just couldn't say it aloud. She had been demonized by the parents she loved, and then raised to be an unfeeling weapon by the man who rescued her from that living hell. Sometimes Anna doubted Elsa would ever feel comfortable enough to say those words. She wouldn't blame her.

"You don't have to say anything," Anna said. "I'm not one of those people who need to hear it. I already know."

"You're more giving than I deserve," Elsa murmured. "I wish I were whole. You deserve someone complete. Someone more than a pale imitation."

"That's not true." Anna frowned when Elsa said nothing. Surely something could break her out of this mood. "You _do_ owe me something," Anna said, grabbing Elsa's left hand with her right and putting her arm on her shoulder. "We're gonna dance. I don't like that you did this with someone else but not me."

Elsa chuckled and nodded, taking the lead by placing her hand over Anna's waist. No music, but the sound of the waves was enough; having Elsa with her was enough. Anna closed her eyes and laid her head on Elsa's shoulder as they swayed in place, not doing anything elaborate or saying anything unnecessary, only enjoying each other's company.

And when finally they moved, they moved in tandem.

Elsa took a step back and Anna took a step forward, following the rhythm of the sea on a stage that existed only for them, their only audience the stars and the moon that embraced them. They danced, their feet sweeping over the sand to bring them close, only for the distance to grow again; but their hands were still linked, and the next moment, they were together once more.

"I thought you'd be a little clumsier," Elsa admitted, stepping back and raising her arm so Anna could twirl, smiling when Anna laughed in celebration of her success.

"I'm not _that_ bad," Anna said.

"In that case…"

Before Anna could protest, Elsa edged forward and dipped her backwards. Gasping aloud and scrabbling to hold onto Elsa, Anna barely found purchase on the suddenly too-slick dress, fingertips almost sliding off the icy fabric. She needn't have feared. Even though her heart thumped in her chest – feeling a vague, foreign satisfaction – Elsa held on and braced her back without effort, pulling her up with the same ease as before. Anna fell back into step with relief, but managed a half-hearted glare at the queen anyway.

"I thought you could handle it," Elsa said.

"And I can," Anna said.

She quickened her next step. Even though Elsa was still leading, she acquiesced and upped the tempo, guiding them through faster and faster steps, throwing in more twirls and the occasional dip, until Anna was kicking up a virtual dust storm with each sweeping step; Elsa was still gliding over the sand with such softness that she left nary a footprint. By the end, Elsa was actually grinning in challenge.

Of course, Anna knew she was outmatched in this contest of sophistication and grace.

She would just have to rely on what she did best. Anna let go and, before Elsa could react, grabbed her by the waist and threw them both down to the ground. Elsa hit the sand on her back, uttering an inelegant grunt while Anna lay sprawled on top of her. She cracked one eye open just as Anna peered down, flashing a bright smile that she hoped would get her out of trouble.

"I'm not sure I've ever ended a dance that way," Elsa murmured. "But then, we always seem to end up like this."

"What's wrong with this way?" Anna leaned down, kissed her on the lips, and bounced up onto her feet to offer the downed queen a hand. "Come on, you said it. All's fair and anything goes!"

"Clever." Elsa rose and brushed off the sand on her dress, and Anna envied the way the granules slid off without resistance. Her own cloak was crusted with the stuff. "Shall we head on to the castle?"

"You have to answer something first," Anna said. Elsa tilted her head, and Anna's smile widened. "Am I a better dancer than Saul?"

Elsa blinked. She turned and walked away a few steps, shoulders shaking, and Anna was just about to start worrying when she heard soft peals of laughter. Peering over her shoulder, Anna was shocked to see Elsa trying to cover up her laughs by hiding her mouth behind her hand, actually close to doubling over while she shook her head with obvious mirth.

"Hey! Why are you laughing?"

"It's just funny seeing you jealous," Elsa said, taking Anna's hand again and setting a slow pace as they continued on their way. "It's always fun with you, Anna."

"I'm taking that as a no," Anna grumbled.

Elsa hummed and said nothing, laughing a little again when Anna kept up a pout. Eventually, though, Anna dropped the act and let her elation show, practically skipping the rest of the way. Only she could make Elsa laugh like that.

Before long, they had reached the end of the beach and were back in the town proper. Anna could recognize the little shops in the marketplace and the homes off in the distance, even without the merchants manning them and the barest of lights illuminating the buildings. Arendelle Castle was only a scant few minutes' walk away, the bridge and gates visible from where they stood. She was home.

Anna dropped her shoes with the intent to put them back on, but one look downwards and she frowned. All the seawater had encrusted a liberal amount of sand on both her feet and the shoes, and while she _could_ just force them back on, that would most likely leave her sore and achy. Before Anna could come up with a plan, Elsa stepped in front of her and bent down.

"Get on," Elsa said.

"Umm…" Anna looked down at her dress, non-magical and not so blessed to be protected from sand and dust. She knew Elsa hated being unclean. "Are you sure?"

"I know all about Alek doing this for you when you two first met," Elsa said, turning back with a raised eyebrow while Anna gaped. "You're not the only one who can be jealous. Get on."

Anna did as she was told, climbing onto Elsa's back and looping her arms loosely around her neck. While Elsa set off towards the castle, Anna hid her grin by pressing her lips to Elsa's bared shoulder, delighting further in the slight pause that incited in Elsa's steady walk. Anna closed her eyes and breathed in the sharp wintry scent that was so distinctly Elsa. Rocked to and fro and deliciously warm in the Arendellian air, kept comfortable by the counteracting cool from Elsa, Anna let her mind wander.

And soon, she drifted off to sleep.

* * *

Anna was asleep.

It was just like her to fall asleep right before arriving home, but Elsa supposed the excitement must have drained her more than she let on. Elsa shook her head in amusement, craning her neck to look at Anna for a moment before shifting to compensate for the princess's slackening grip. Elsa walked the rest of the way in silence, occasionally gazing up to admire the moon, which always reminded her so much of herself. In that way, maybe Anna was the sun. It would fit. Elsa knew herself to be cold and imperfect, but Anna was bright and whole. How strange, Elsa thought, that the moon would embrace the sun.

She schooled her expression to neutrality when approaching Arendelle Castle, unsurprised that there were guards posted at the gates. What _did_ catch her off-guard was the presence of King Agdar.

"Queen Elsa," Agdar said, nodding his respect but choosing to keep his dignity. Much unlike the pitiful display of groveling the Duke of Weselton had presented, Agdar stood tall. Perhaps the only chink in his armor was his brief glance towards Anna, but he knew better than to question her odd location.

"Lord Agdar." Elsa likewise glanced at the small troop of guards, not an overt force but certainly more than was warranted during peacetime. "You do not seem surprised to see me."

"I assure you that it was a most pleasant surprise," Agdar said, giving her a strained smile and gesturing towards the inside of the castle. "And I welcome you back to Arendelle Castle."

"I would not blame you for inquiring about your daughter," Elsa said. Maybe she was still in a good mood from before, but she found herself quite amused by the steadfast way Agdar avoided the subject.

"…It _is_ a surprise to see Anna lying where she is now. I apologize that she has inconvenienced you." Agdar cleared his throat when Elsa waved her hand. "Has she been well?"

"If you are asking whether I have mistreated her, I assure you that Anna is…an honored guest," Elsa said. She strode towards the castle keep, careful to avoid jostling Anna and keeping her voice low. "I brought her here because she missed home, and yourself."

"I have also…missed her dearly." Agdar sighed. "I have confidence in your words and trust that Anna was treated well, but I cannot help but worry. She is only a child."

"You underestimate her. She is not so naïve and helpless as you might think, Agdar."

"Perhaps, but a parent will always care for their child regardless of whether they have grown."

Elsa pursed her lips at the reminder of her own parents, but Agdar couldn't have known his casual statement had been a jibe. It had been a delicate task to _not_ think about her past, her parents, one she had undertaken since she first set foot in Arendelle, but now that the dam had opened all the repressed thoughts burst forth. She wondered if her old home was still around, or whether the scene had been cleaned and the area restored. She wondered if the rumors of what happened there had become a wives' tale to scare unruly children. She wondered if she might still feel something, if she were to stand there once more, whether she would still be Queen Elsa or be reduced to that scared, lost child again.

"Queen Elsa?" Agdar asked.

Elsa snapped out of her reverie, only then noticing they had entered the Great Hall. Agdar was watching her, either inquisitive about her thoughts or concerned for Anna. Elsa wasn't sure which irked her more.

"I was only admiring the architecture. Arendelle Castle is very beautiful, and with a much longer history than the Southern Isles," Elsa said. "Last I was here, I did not have a chance to explore its intricacies."

A portly woman with a round, jovial face – Elsa assumed she was an attendant – walked up to them and dipped into an unpracticed curtsey. "Your Majesty, I can take Princess Anna to her bedroom. I've been attending to her since she was a wee thing–"

"You must be Gerda," Elsa said. At least Agdar hid his surprise well, but Gerda spoke for both of them with the blinking of her wide eyes. "Anna has told me about you. I leave her in your good hands, then."

It would have been preferable to stay with Anna, but she still had some unfinished matters in Arendelle. Elsa turned and allowed Gerda to take Anna from her back, somewhat impressed with the older woman's strength. She watched Gerda travel up the stairs until both she and Anna disappeared from view, and then turned back to the king.

Agdar cleared his throat. "If there is anything you might require–"

"Not your presence any longer," Elsa interjected. "But I will require the library, and I am not to be disturbed. I'm sure you will be able to accommodate me without my direct input."

"…Of course."

Elsa strode toward the library without another word.

She _knew_ the Mirror was somewhere in Arendelle. It was just the same as last time she came, bearing ships and flags of war; Elsa could hear the song of the Mirror in the air, a hymn louder and clearer than she had heard anywhere else, but she could not pinpoint the location of the shards. It was a strange sensation. She heard the song and felt the call, but there was no direction, no source, as though the Mirror were everywhere and nowhere all at once. Elsa had even tried summoning the shards to her as she did so many times before, but without success.

Perhaps Arendelle Castle would have some clues. Its library was vaster than that of the Southern Isles Castle; Elsa had been truthful when noting Arendelle's longer, much more cultured history. Relatively speaking the Southern Isles was a new nation in comparison to the ancient kingdom of Arendelle, long established and flourishing by the time the islands were populated. No, Arendelle was an old place.

And as rumor would have it, Arendelle was home to an even more ancient civilization.

Elsa slid a black-bound tome out from the shelves, deciphering the gold runes engraved on its cover. On its pages was depicted short, stout creatures resembling boulders…

Trolls.

* * *

It was called the Valley of the Living Rock.

Elsa eyed the hissing geothermal vents expelling steam, feeling the uncomfortable warmth shifting beneath her feet. She traversed the upwards slope with careful steps, taking in her surroundings as she went. Green and violet lights of the aurora borealis lit up the skies. Lichens and mosses thrived on the igneous rock. Magma flowed just beneath the surface of this valley, supplying new rock and giving new life to the valley. If Elsa didn't already know the truth of this place, she might have mistaken that for the reason behind its name.

Up above was a rounded clearing surrounded by several raised terraces, still the same dark igneous rock spotted with green, but the dozens, even hundreds of small boulders that sat upon those terraces were a lighter shade of grey. Nothing about those rocks appeared to be anything special. Elsa strode into the center of the clearing with her head held high.

"I know you're here," Elsa said.

Nothing responded, but she had expected as much. Elsa raised her hand, summoning lightning to flow through her index and middle finger, and crouched just low enough that she was in a battle-ready stance. One pivot and she could hurl lightning through the entire clearing until nothing was left.

"You will show yourselves to me," Elsa said again, raising her voice. "Or I will answer your silence with death. I have little patience for you."

A loud rumble.

A dull tremor.

A heavy groan.

Every single boulder rolled off the terraces of their own accord, the sound of crashing stone ringing in her ears as they approached. Elsa straightened and allowed the electricity to dissipate, satisfied that her demand was being met. Of course, she kept her guard up. In only seconds she was surrounded by the stones, and she knew better than to underestimate the creatures because of their size.

Before her eyes, each boulder unfurled, the uniform greyness opening to reveal arms and legs, short spikes of grass for hair and faces carved into the stone. None of them were exactly the same, though they shared some of the same features, wide noses and pearly white teeth, moss substituted for clothing. And in particular, they all had the same unwelcoming expression.

"You are the trolls, then." Elsa nodded her head in greeting, but she did not lower herself to their level. None stood taller than a foot off the ground."

One troll, wearing pink crystals and bearing stringy, yellow grass for hair, stepped forward from the rest. She hissed, "You're not welcome here, Wraith." All the rest murmured in agreement.

Elsa frowned. "Understandable, but you have something of mine. Return it to me, and I will leave. I have no desire to be here any longer than necessary."

"You don't belong here, Wraith. I told you to leave now–"

She was interrupted by whispers in the background, and the trolls parted to clear a path for one boulder in particular. It unfurled, revealing an older troll wearing a grass cape and an elaborate headdress. Stepping in front of the first troll, he told her, "Bulda! Be at peace. I will speak with her."

"And you are…?" Elsa asked.

"My name is Pabbie." Looking her over, the wizened troll bowed low, touching his forehead to the ground before rising. "And I welcome you, Mirror-Child."

Elsa raised an eyebrow. "Interesting that you should call me that when I'm here precisely for that reason. I wondered where the Mirror could be…and then I found this place. Where have you hidden the shards?"

"We have kept them safe from those who would abuse the power of the Mirror," Pabbie said. "I cannot hand them over to you."

Elsa paused for a second, no longer, while she thought about her reply.

"Then I will kill you."

At once, all the other trolls bristled. Some of the younger ones were maybe neutral towards her, but Elsa noticed how the elders were all on edge in her presence, skittish and agitated, as though her mere existence was an offense. Bulda looked torn between revulsion and terror.

Only Pabbie was unaffected, continuing to smile. "I do not believe that you will." Elsa furrowed her eyebrows, and Pabbie added, "If you had found this place only months ago, you would have attacked without ever thinking to ask for the shards. You come in peace."

It was true. For all of her threats, Elsa found herself reluctant to kill these creatures, being able to understand their desire for isolation. It felt wrong to exterminate this ancient culture when all they had done was hide themselves from the world, praying for peace and quiet. Perhaps it was Anna's influence as well, but Elsa had no interest in leaving a massacre behind her. But still…

"It doesn't change that I won't leave without the Mirror," Elsa said.

"What you said before was true. You are the Mirror-Child, and the Mirror belongs to you, and only you," Pabbie agreed. "But do you know what it is that you seek?"

"I know enough," Elsa said. It was her missive to _complete_ the Mirror. She didn't need to know its history to track it down. "It's an artifact of great power, originating from a drop of moonlight. It was shattered, and then the pieces scattered."

"Yes, and that was for the best," Pabbie said. "It is a dangerous thing, not meant to be completed again. No good can come of its return."

"I don't believe that decision is for you to decide."

"Then maybe I can convince you of the truth."

Elsa frowned. She doubted anything he could say would convince her of abandoning her mission, but at the same time, she grudgingly appreciated that Pabbie was willing to explain and not speak in riddles. If she were honest, part of her _was_ curious. "Speak, then."

Pabbie nodded. "As you said, a drop of moonlight once fell from the sky. Here it fell. Here it froze the water, and the Mirror came into being. Upon its surface was reflected the desires of the heart, and those desires would become reality. We are proof of that. We are the living rock because we yearned for life, and our wish was granted."

"And yet you would leave the Mirror broken?"

"Yes," Pabbie said, with utmost conviction. Not the sort Elsa had heard before from would-be martyrs and glory-seeking heroes. Those people did what they did for some grandiose purpose, human in scope and in the end, negligible. What Pabbie had was much, much realer than that. Pabbie _knew_ that it had to be so, for a reason greater than could be spoken, beyond even what he was explaining.

It simply was.

"The Mirror is not difficult to use, but impossible to control," Pabbie continued. "It is not sentient. It has no will of its own save for the desires of the one who wields it…and you must understand that all beings possess reckless desire. Anyone who could force their will upon the Mirror, claim its heart, could turn their desires into reality. Immortal kings. Shifting lands. Burning skies. It was chaos."

_She watched as the air condensed into falling droplets of black water, as ice and crystal rained from the sky like judgment._

_She watched as geysers of flame and toxic fume erupted from the ground, as the choking sulfur suffocated men in a shadowy haze._

_She watched as the sky tore apart because there was no atmosphere anymore, as the sky blue ripped open to expose a starry darkness like a gaping maw._

Elsa shut her eyes in an attempt to block out the visions. When she opened them again she was back in the present, seeing Pabbie shake his head with sympathy.

"What did you do to me?" Elsa asked.

"Nothing. If you saw anything, those were your own memories," Pabbie said.

But she couldn't have those memories. She had never seen any of that before now, and if Pabbie was truthful, those were visions from thousands and thousands of years ago. Elsa clamped one hand over her eye, feeling a headache spike through from the back of her skull.

"Continue," Elsa said, biting her words out through clenched teeth.

"No human records will recall those days. Even among the trolls, the story has become myth. None of us remember for ourselves, but we still feel the truth in our stone hearts," Pabbie said. "Chaos, Elsa. Desire is not an evil thing, nor does evil even exist. But absolute gratification, when all our desires are satiated at the moment of inception, when no dreams are left save for destruction…chaos."

"Something had to have changed. How did the Mirror break?" Elsa asked.

"One woman came upon the Mirror. She was…different, from the rest of humanity." Pabbie closed his eyes and bowed to the ground, and all the other trolls followed suit. "She had no desire."

"Like me," Elsa murmured. She remembered the words of the Sorcerer, right before they fought. She could not be manipulated because she had no desire–

"No!" Pabbie said. "What you have done is repress and deny your desires. It was absolution that this woman reached. She attained understanding of her emotions and her desires. She accepted herself for herself. She chose to let go of her trappings, not bury them. When she came in contact with the Mirror…"

"It shattered. Because there was nothing to reflect." Elsa bowed her head. "Letting go…"

"You're the furthest thing possible from that," Bulda interrupted. She had been angry and fearful before. Now she looked at her with sadness, and a tinge of pity. "You have become a Wraith."

"Why do you call me that? Wraith?" Elsa asked.

"We are a people deeply attuned to the self, to the matters of the heart, and you, Elsa, have committed an unspeakable atrocity," Pabbie answered. Elsa _knew_ what he was going to say next. Dread froze in her veins. "You have denied your heart. You threw it aside and forgot yourself, Elsa."

"Is there…" Elsa swallowed. She never thought she would ever ask for _help,_ and even now her pride rankled at the indignity, chafed against once again being at the mercy of others. But this could be her last chance. She had to try. "Is there a way for me to undo this?"

"It depends on the reason. Why do you wish to undo this magic?"

"Because…" Was there a right answer? Was Pabbie looking for her to say something in particular? "Because I've found someone who I love, and I want to love her fully. Not this sad mockery. I want her to have more than this ugly shadow, this Wraith–"

"Then I cannot help you," Pabbie said, raising his hand and turning away.

Elsa whipped her arm forward, sending a wave of ice arcing around the troll, but while the others exclaimed their fear, Pabbie stopped silent in his tracks. She shook with anger. She refused to be denied. She would not suffer this condescension.

"You will tell me what I need to do," Elsa said.

"You hear, but you do not listen," Pabbie said. Turning around, he fixed her with a regretful gaze. "You remind me of him, the other man. It was the same. Though he asked for counsel, he chose not to act."

"Someone else was here?"

"Gustaf. Son of Markus. Husband of Celina. Father of Odon." Pabbie smiled, but it was a painful thing. "If he had succeeded in defeating his father, perhaps none of this travesty would have occurred."

Elsa's eyes widened, disbelieving of what she had heard, but she heard no deceit in Pabbie's voice. And why would he craft such an outlandish lie? It had to be true. "You gave counsel to Gustaf? What did you tell him? When was this–?"

"Before you knew him, but after your existence was made known to his family," Pabbie said.

"But that's impossible. We met after Markus saved me, and Gustaf was in the Southern Isles. Or was he with Markus as well?" Elsa searched through her memories, but Gustaf had never been on the returning ship leaving Arendelle. And she clearly remembered their first meeting, being introduced at the castle…

Pabbie shook his head. "No. At the time in your mind, he was not with his father."

"Such a polite boy. Asked us what he should do," Bulda added.

"Why did you give _him_ counsel?" Elsa whirled around to Bulda. "Why do you not consider _him_ a Wraith, when you condemn me for doing the same–"

"Gustaf was not a Wraith."

It was such an absurd thing to say that Elsa only heard the individual words without registering their combined meaning for a moment. Even when she did, she only grew more confused. It was illogical. Nothing about that made sense, but Pabbie seemed determined to not give her a straight answer. If that was his decision, there was no need to heed his words either. Elsa turned away, preparing to leave the wretched valley. She found no value in his cryptic answers. Before she left, however, she looked back to Pabbie, standing there staring at her with saddened eyes.

"I'll be back for the Mirror," Elsa promised. "And that time, nothing you say will stop me."

"Remember, Elsa, Mirror-Child. There is great beauty in your magic…" Pabbie sighed. "But also great danger. Remember that always, Elsa."

"Believe me. I already know."

Elsa departed, leaving behind the edge of comprehension she had gained for that brief, brief moment.
