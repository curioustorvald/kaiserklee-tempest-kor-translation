**Chapter 9: And It Looks Like I'm the Queen**

Today, Anna decided to head to the libraries.

Anna had been everywhere else and having just one place uncharted gnawed at her sense of completion. Well, there was still one other place; but when she mentioned it, Edmund had been outright belligerent about the so-called _forbidden tower_. Of course, him telling her _not_ to go made her want to even more, but Elsa had warned her before not to trespass. Anna decided on the libraries for now.

She was sure nothing could possibly go wrong.

Until she started to turn the doorknob, and a gloved hand clamped down on her wrist.

Anna screamed at the ghostly apparition suddenly standing where she was sure no one had been before, and she tripped backwards when she was released without a second warning. She stumbled but managed to keep on her feet – all her time walking over ice was starting to pay off – and stared with wide eyes as the figure stepped out from the darkness.

"You have a healthy set of lungs."

"W-Wait. You're not a ghost?" Anna took a closer look at the stranger and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw him roll his eyes.

"Do I look like one?"

She wanted to say yes. Whoever this man was, it was obvious he almost never saw the light of day. Even if sunlight in the Southern Isles was limited, nobody was pale enough to look bloodless. Well, except for maybe Elsa, but instead of her snow-white skin, he had skin white like chalk. With a gaunt face and hollow cheeks framed by long black hair, Anna honestly felt no guilt in thinking he was a ghost at first sight. Especially when he just crept out of nowhere.

But a white lie never hurt anybody.

"No!" Anna said. "You just surprised me."

"Hmm. I'm not going to ask your name, since everybody knows who you are. I'm Tobias, the fourth prince. Not particularly pleased to make your acquaintance." With that, Tobias brushed past her and made to enter the library himself.

Whatever courtesy Anna was willing to give Tobias just flew out the window. "Hey, it is _not_ nice to just–"

"My mistake, I'm sorry," Tobias snorted, turning his head only to look down his nose at her like he was staring down a particularly ugly insect. "I should refrain from angering the queen's beloved pet. Who knows what could happen to me?"

"Wh-What did you call me?"

"Oh, please. Everybody knows," Tobias said. "Now if you're done parading your moronic tendencies, I would like to leave your presence."

And before Anna could retort, he flung the door open, walked in, and slammed it shut in her face. When she tried to open the door again, the doorknob only rattled; Tobias had locked it. Anna banged her fist against the hardwood, furious and confused, but there was no response. For several minutes she simply stood there and fumed at what was perhaps the most ungracious treatment she had received yet, and then impulse made her lean down. Placing her ear at the keyhole, Anna listened for anything at all.

And to her surprise, she _did_ hear a voice.

"Is he talking to himself?" Anna wondered aloud.

She couldn't quite make out the voice, but she assumed it was Tobias. But was it just a little too deep to be him? Although the words were indistinct, the moment Anna began listening in she could tell the speaker abruptly, deliberately cut himself off as though _knowing_ she was there. Then a sudden force pulsed outward from the door, like a crashing ocean wave that was air instead of water; Anna was thrown right off her feet and landed on her back three feet away, head slamming against the floor with a dull crack. She saw stars as the heavy impact knocked her breath away.

"Hey! Are you all right?"

Anna barely registered whoever it was. Her head was still swimming when someone lifted her into a sitting position, and only after long moments of blinking did her vision regain some measure of clarity. Short-cropped blond hair, toweringly tall but just a little gangly, and features hawkish but otherwise youthful. Alek, her fuzzy thoughts told her, this one was Alek, the one close to – Alvard.

"This is _not_ good," Anna mumbled.

"Not good? Hey. Can you see my hand right now?" Alek held out his hand and waved it back and forth, and Anna frowned until she realized he was trying to check her for a _concussion_. Whoops.

She grabbed his hand and said, "Sorry, I meant I'm fine. Umm, thanks anyway." Shaking her head to clear her mind, Anna got back to her feet. She nearly fell again from vertigo.

"…Yeah, no," Alek said, scowling. "Look, I'm not the type of person to talk around something. You don't seem well and I'm not equipped to check, so I'm going to bring you to someone who is."

"No, I'm fine, thanks." Anna half-suspected this was some sort of ploy to murder her for what happened to his brother so she tried to escape, to no avail; Alek grabbed her by the arm, not exactly rough but certainly not gentle either.

"You're being stupid," Alek said flatly, and he pulled her along.

Anna had no choice but to follow, but her balance was still a little off and she realized she must have hit her head harder than she thought. When Alek noticed her stumbling along, he heaved a sigh and bent down. Anna stared at the strange sight until he turned his head with a grimace.

"I'll carry you there," Alek said.

"Umm, thanks, but no thanks–"

"Look, this is going to take all day otherwise."

She still thought this was a trap, but if she was going to her death, she might as well be carried there. Anna shrugged and scrambled up his back, and like that they were off again. Alek walked with long strides that left Anna feeling like she was on a horse, head bobbing up and down until she felt sick.

Anna didn't realize she made any sound of discomfort, but Alek shifted and to her surprise said, "Sorry, I'll go a little slower. Just try not to throw up on me."

"You're being awfully nice. Aren't you mad? About Alvard?" Anna mumbled. She must have _really_ hit her head. She was just blurting out whatever came to mind.

"One day, I will avenge him," Alek agreed, but his confident tone shifted to confusion when he added, "But what does that have to do with you?"

"Well, I was…there?"

Alek took a deep breath and hefted her higher as she began to slip off his back. "I've heard," Alek said, but Anna was shocked to hear him mutter, "And I feel I owe you an apology."

"What?" Anna shook her head, sure she had misheard. "Did you just say–"

"Please don't think badly of Alvard," Alek said. "I'm not sure _what_ he was thinking, but I can tell you that hurting you was never part of his plan. He would never hurt an innocent; Alvard always, _always_ taught me that our duty was to protect."

Oh. Through her still-foggy vision, Anna watched as Alek bowed his head a little from the proud stance he bore before. Truth be told, she had never even considered what Alvard had been like as a person. He had just been the assassin. Seeing how torn up Alek was, she couldn't find the heart to tell him his beloved brother had deliberately aimed for her, either to bait Elsa or out of simple spite.

"…I believe you. Apology accepted," Anna whispered.

Alek nodded and murmured a quiet thanks, and for a long stretch of their journey to wherever – Anna had a feeling now that he wasn't really trying to murder her – they were silent. After Anna had turned his words over for the fourth time, however, she had to correct something.

"Elsa's innocent too."

"That accursed witch is hardly innocent," Alek spat, and Anna was too shocked by the sudden venom to protest. "She killed Alvard, and imprisoned you here–"

"Alvard did try to kill her too," Anna said, and a muscle twitched in Alek's jaw. "Besides, _I'm_ not even complaining about the imprisonment or whatever, so I don't know why you're throwing a fit."

Alek turned his head, brow furrowing and eyes oddly sympathetic. "You're stronger than you look, to bear Elsa's perverse cruelties. I can't imagine what it must be like to live under her whim."

"…I think you have the wrong idea. What kind of–?"

"We're here," Alek said, freeing one hand to knock on the door. Anna had been too preoccupied and dizzy to notice, but now she realized they were back in the princes' wing.

When the door opened, they were greeted by Saul.

_I am just running into everyone I don't want to run into today._

"She hit her head," Alek explained.

Saul nodded and let them in, keeping the door open for what Anna assumed was propriety's sake. Alek deposited her on the sofa leaning against the far wall, and she noted that Saul's room was decorated with blueprints and a variety of woodcraft. An entire section of wall was so marked up the originally white wallpaper was barely visible, the entire expanse covered with scrawled diagrams and mind-bogglingly complicated designs of inventions Anna had never seen before. On the shelves sat intricate wooden miniatures of ships and cannons detailed down to the individual gear.

Out of everything practical though, Anna noticed a lone snowflake in the middle and standing in its own plinth above the rest.

"I leave her to your care," Alek said. Turning to Anna, he added, "And I hope to see you around. It was nice meeting you, Anna."

"Yeah, you too," Anna said. Far from what she had expected, she genuinely liked Alek. She would need to do something about his strange hate for Elsa, but aside from being a little cryptic and melodramatic about the whole perverse tortures thing, Alek really wasn't that bad a guy.

Except for how he left her with Saul. Anna had no idea why, but Saul gave her bad vibes ever since that time in Elsa's office, and no, it had nothing to do with the way he looked at Elsa.

It just made her chest tighten and her stomach plummet, but no, there was no connection.

"I don't believe we've ever been introduced," Saul said, walking closer and kneeling to eye level. "I'm Saul. Alek may not have mentioned it, but I am the resident medic here."

"Aren't you a prince?" Anna snorted.

"I am multifaceted," Saul answered, making it sound entirely matter-of-fact and not in any way bragging. Anna grudgingly gave him that, considering the evidence all around his room. "I'm going to check your head now." With that warning, he dove his hand into her hair in search for the bruise, and Anna winced when he found it. "Are you feeling nausea, or a headache, or…?"

"Not really anymore."

"Follow my finger with your eyes, please." If she weren't so bewildered by the surreal situation Anna might not have done it, but as it were, she obediently followed the slender digit back and forth, up and down, until Saul made a satisfied hum in the back of his throat.

"So…?" Anna asked.

Saul rose and walked over to an antique-looking chest, flicking the latch open. "Luckily you don't have a concussion, only a rather egregious bruise, but your balance will be affected for now so I recommend you stay for a little while. I'll make you some herbal tea while you wait, and it should help you recover."

"Are you sure I can't just leave now?"

"I would not return you to Elsa while any less than perfect," Saul said. Retrieving a packet of tea leaves from the chest and then two beautiful cups likely of his own design – one of ivory and glazed with magnolia, the other obsidian and glazed with lilac – Saul began brewing at the nearby table with what Anna thought was an unnecessarily expert air.

Was there anything this guy _couldn't_ do?

"Well, I probably still won't be as perfect as you," Anna grumbled. She wrung her hands together and glared down at her lap. Why was she so dead set on comparing herself against him? She just felt so inadequate all of a sudden, and even though she had never thought of herself as _above_ anyone, she had certainly never felt quite so useless either. "_I_ couldn't help her manage the supply thing."

"But you make her happy."

"How do you know that?" Anna asked.

"Look outside," Saul said. "You've noticed, haven't you? Ever since you arrived, the snowstorm has been slowly weakening. And that time, when we first met. I'd never seen Elsa so content before." Saul returned and handed her a cup of tea, a small smile on his face. Anna watched him as he took a deep breath of the aroma first, then closed his eyes and took a careful sip.

p>The habit really, really reminded her of Elsa.

"…You like her, right?" Anna asked.

Saul stilled. Slowly, he moved the tea cup away, and Anna could see the tinge of mourning in his otherwise polite smile. "May I sit?"

"It's your room," Anna muttered. She scooted over.

"We met when we were still children, but from the moment I saw her, I knew," Saul said, sitting down next to her and nursing the cup in his hands, rolling it in between his palms as he spoke. "I knew she was the one I would wait for. Her grace, her nobility of spirit. Nobody will ever be able to compare."

_Suddenly I don't want to hear this,_ Anna thought uncomfortably, but she hung onto his words, transfixed and anxious.

"Every moment we spend apart is filled with thoughts of her," Saul continued, with curiously restrained passion. "But though my soul cries for her, I know she will never return my affections and I dare not even dream of it. I only want to be by her side, Anna. It matters not how brief the time, but as long as I can be of some use to her, that time will be filled with the utmost joy."

"Umm – I think you should drink the tea before it gets cold," Anna said hurriedly, diving nose-first into her own cup.

She didn't know if Saul had ever said anything like that to Elsa, but if he had, Anna figured that was a perfectly good reason for her to _not_ want anything to do with him. Either way, Anna was completely sure she didn't want Saul saying any more of it to _her_. It was romantic enough to read that sort of thing in fairytales, but to hear someone actually say it?

_Grace – nobility of spirit – soul must cry – filled with joy – I didn't think anybody really talked like that!_ Anna shivered into her tea, then hoped it wasn't spiked with anything that was making Saul act funny.

"You are lucky to have her," Saul said.

Anna spat out a mouthful of tea.

"Wait, I'm sorry, what?"

Saul tilted his head as Anna looked on in horror, feeling heat creep up the back of her neck until the tips of her ears burned red. "You don't have to hide anything; I have no intention of getting in between you two. You are involved with Elsa, correct?"

"_What_? I-I don't even…I don't know what you're talking about!" Anna took a deep breath, but far from calming her nerves, it made her want to hyperventilate. "Me and Elsa? W-We're both girls!"

"There's nothing wrong with that," Saul shrugged. "And it is common knowledge that Elsa chose to risk herself to save you from Alvard, and what more, you two have shared a room for weeks now–"

"We sleep in separate beds!" Anna said. Suddenly, what Tobias mocked her about and what Alek said about Elsa's sadistic tortures rushed back with alarming clarity. Did everyone think…?

Saul smiled knowingly, and Anna was sure her face was the same color as her hair by now. "But this is Queen Elsa, the same queen who distances anyone and everyone. If she felt nothing for you, she would not go to such lengths to protect you."

"So you're saying that Elsa–" Anna couldn't finish her sentence. She clutched at her tea like it was a lifeline, hands shaking and breath coming in short, ragged spurts.

"Are you averse to the idea of two women?"

Anna shook her head. She wasn't the type to judge, but she wasn't attracted to women, right? But now that someone, _anyone_ brought up the subject, Anna realized she had never thought about it. She lived in a protective bubble with no one but her father and very familiar servants, so of course not. She found Hans good-looking though. But was she actually attracted to him? No. She was flattered by his attention, but attracted? No. Did she find Elsa…?

"This is _not_ good," Anna groaned, covering her face in her hands trying to hide the heat snaking its way up her neck. Elsa was beautiful. She was all those things Saul talked about, but in a less creepy way, and Anna realized just how much she had been ogling her perfect, practically translucent skin, her silk-like platinum blonde hair, her tiny smile curling at the edge of her lips…

"I apologize for making assumptions," Saul said, awkwardly patting her back.

"N-No, I can't even blame you…"

"Well, no," Saul agreed. "You do realize the entire castle is gossiping about this?"

"Please just stop talking."

"Elsa has been furious." Anna looked up to see Saul in deep thought. "It makes sense now, if there was nothing going on. She would want to protect your reputation. But, of course, her reaction to those who spread the rumors only seemed to confirm them…"

"What did she do?" Anna asked.

"You remember Commander Andersen?" Saul smiled when Anna nodded. "Last I hear, he was called to the throne room. You can go see for yourself."

* * *

Elsa paid no mind to anything anyone said about her. She knew what they said, of course – that she was a wicked sorceress, a monster who had cursed the lands, even that she was an usurper – but she knew exactly what she was doing. After so long she had grown numb to their words, but to hear them speak ill of _Anna_ was…intolerable. Anna was not like her. She should never have been mentioned in the same vein as her, and Elsa would not allow it to continue.

"Commander Andersen. I believe you are in my service to defend our kingdom," Elsa said, casting a frigid gaze down to the boorish man. "So why, then, do you find it necessary to engage in trivial gossip like an uncultured barbarian?"

One of Alvard's in the past, Elsa knew. It was little surprise to find that Andersen had been teaching his men to spread malicious lies about Anna, the _least_ of which was about their supposed illicit relationship. Crude, lewd things for which Elsa had no words to describe her revulsion.

"With all due respect," Andersen said, voice a mixture of fear and defiance, "I don't understand what you're trying to say, Your Majesty."

Elsa slammed her hand against the arm of her throne, feeling her power hum beneath her fingertips, the crackling of electricity and the chill of ice straining and begging to be released. The sheer force of her ire shattered a window, letting the storm winds whip their way inside. "I tire of games. Will you speak, or must I pass the same judgment on to you as I did your men?"

Andersen glanced over at the window and then back, swallowing nervously and bowing his head the tiniest bit further. "I assure you, Your Majesty, that I had nothing to do with it."

It took every last bit of control Elsa had to contain the mounting rush through her veins. She had barely noticed the change until now, so gradual it had been, but her muted emotions were returning slowly but surely. When she was with Anna, Elsa could _feel_ again, the hint of nervousness and the inexhaustible spring of warmth only the bright girl's presence could give her.

On the other hand, memories of the past resurfaced along with those emotions. And as more and more of her focus slipped, Elsa found it harder to maintain the mask she had worn for so long. Even her rage manifested itself more powerfully, and once something threatened Anna…

"I wonder if I should take the word of a man desperate to keep his life, or that of a man in his death throes," Elsa murmured. She watched as Andersen paled, feeling a surge of vicious satisfaction. "Many of the others chose only to speak at the end, Commander, but humans will always speak."

Was _she_ still a human, Elsa wondered? After what she had done to herself? Anna made her feel like she still was; Anna could convince her that she was more than just an empty shell, but the moment her warmth was missing from her side, Elsa wondered if she had made a mistake. She had allowed her powers to define who she was. There was a time she used to revel in what she thought was freedom, had been able to tell herself she was now above mankind. She used to think herself free from pain after what she did, but ever since Anna…

"I – I really had nothing to do–"

"If that is your last word, then I will believe you," Elsa said. She waited for the reluctant hope to grow, for Andersen to believe he had been allowed reprieve, before adding, "But then I must punish you for another fault, Commander. Surely you remember my orders for the Princess of Arendelle to be treated as a guest of honor while she was transported here?"

Andersen paled once again, even worse than last time if that were possible. Even from afar, Elsa could see the cold sweat on his brow. "Y-Your Majesty–"

"There is no excuse I will accept," Elsa hissed.

It had been too long since she allowed her power to run free.

Ice ripped from her fingertips, carving through both carpet and stone as it arced way towards the man. It was so fast he couldn't have reacted, faster than the human eye could hope to follow, four tendrils of ice hardening around his arms and legs and holding him in place as he kneeled completely helpless. With a single thought, the temperature of the already freezing ice dropped further, to the point where smoke rose and Elsa could smell searing flesh. Andersen let out a choked sob and then a scream as his skin burned into a blackened husk, but even that silenced when the ice spread over his face.

Well, she would put him out of his misery.

Elsa raised a hand and a large icicle blossomed from her palm, almost like a bone slowly being pulled from her body. Fully formed, the spear of ice simply hovered in the air at the tip of her fingers, a long, jagged blade with cruelly serrated edges. Elsa took aim and prepared to let it fly…

"_Elsa!_"

The spear shattered as her concentration broke. Like waking from a dream, like rising from the depths of an ocean, all of her bloodlust vanished at the sound of Anna's voice. Elsa looked on in shock as Anna burst in, breathing heavily and eyes wide at the gruesome scene that welcomed her. Anna looked up, the darker, warmer blue of her eyes meeting her own. Elsa couldn't understand the pleading she saw.

_Why do you ask for mercy on his behalf, after what he did to you?_

"Please, Elsa. Stop," Anna whispered. "This isn't you."

As though her body weren't her own, Elsa felt her hand move of its own accord. With a wave, the ice encasing Andersen shattered as well, leaving him burned and gasping for air but alive.

"I don't want you to see this," Elsa said, desperate to get Anna away from the evidence of her inhumanity. _I don't want you to be afraid of me. I don't want you to be like everyone else._ "Go. I will have someone tend to his wounds."

"…All right," Anna said quietly.

She left without another word. As the doors slammed shut again, Elsa leaned back against her throne, feeling for the first time in forever, fear.

* * *

Dinner was a tense affair, neither of them willing to speak of what had happened but unable to find distractions. Anna ate in silence; Elsa once again refused to eat and looked away from her eyes, stress lining the corners of her pursed lips as she clutched her arms to herself. Anna noticed the gloves were back. Even when they retired to their shared room, no words were spoken, and they went to their respective beds.

Sleep came uneasily.

A loud shout pierced Anna's fitful slumber. Sitting up sharply but hearing nothing else, she wondered if it had been a dream. For the past weeks, Elsa slept without a sound if she slept at all; Anna suspected she only made a show of it, and a long night of vigil had confirmed it. It was dark all around her save for some moonlight spilling in from the window, and looking across from her bed, she could see Elsa.

Another shout caught her attention. Her eyes widened in concern, now that she was sure the cry had really come from Elsa. She scrambled out of bed and hurried over.

"Elsa?" Anna murmured, tentatively laying a hand on her shoulder.

Elsa rolled over, curled up in a ball on the bed, form trembling visibly. Anna had never seen her like this before, vulnerable even beyond that one time she had been injured. Elsa continued shaking her head side to side, uttering a long string of unintelligible words, hands clutching at her sheets as she flinched like she was in pain.

Nightmares, Anna realized. No wonder she refused to sleep. Anna bit her lip as Elsa gave another sudden flinch. What should she do? Should she wake her? Or would Elsa be upset and embarrassed about Anna discovering this weakness? But she couldn't just leave Elsa like this…

The decision was taken out of her hands when Elsa gave another loud cry. This time she clutched her chest where her heart was, fingers digging into the area with such visceral strength that her nails cut into her flesh, flecks of blood seeping through her nightshirt even as the wound began to heal. Ice spread over the canopy of her bed, snaking across the fabric and then down the supporting beams.

"Elsa!" Anna shook her harder.

Instantly, Elsa snapped her eyes open; but they weren't the gentle eyes Anna had become used to. They were feral like those of a wounded animal, and Anna thought she even saw the blue of her eyes flare so brightly they glowed. But it was only for an instant. Even as Elsa continued to clutch at her chest, she pushed Anna away with a wild swing of her free hand. Another pained moan ripped past Elsa's lips as she doubled over, and this time Anna recognized the sound as one of loss. Mourning, as though something precious had been torn from her.

Anna's heart throbbed as she watched Elsa suffer. Fighting past her struggling, Anna wrapped her arm around Elsa, propping her up so that when she held her trembling form, Elsa's head rested on her shoulder and her forehead against her neck. Shock washed over her when Elsa suddenly, instinctively wrapped her arms around her waist, quivering violently.

"A-Anna?" Elsa whispered, clinging to her frame. In the dim moonlight spilling in, Anna could see Elsa's normally controlled face marred with fright as recognition returned, but her senses clearly had not. Her gaze was still vacant and delirious, staring blankly with feverish light. What would it be like to wake from a nightmare and wonder with horror if you were still dreaming?

"It's me. It's Anna, I'm right here." It took everything she had to keep the tremble out of her voice as she rested her cheek on the top of Elsa's head.

"Anna…?" Elsa murmured, eyes slowly sliding shut again. "I-I have to check…I have to see…I don't want to be broken anymore…the tower…Anna…"

Elsa's grip didn't slacken as she fell still again, trembling abating and breathing relaxing into a regular pattern at last. Smoothing back her hair, Anna cradled her gently, allowing tears to finally break free from her eyelids and slide down her face.

"You're not broken," Anna whispered.

Whatever made Elsa the way she was lay in the tower.

Anna decided then and there that she would confront whatever was tormenting her.
