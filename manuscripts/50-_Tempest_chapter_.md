**Chapter 50: At the End of the World**

Hans did not know the name of the man he killed.

All he knew was that the man fought valiantly, even against the prince that he should have, by all rights, served. There had been a moment when their eyes met and Hans saw the fear there, and also the rage and the bloodlust which overtook all men in battle; but past that, Hans was certain he had been a good man. When the moment passed, the man was dead. Hans felt no regret. Good man he might have been, but they were on different sides. Even though he might have thought he was serving his country, the Southern Isles had long since fallen into darkness. Hans _knew_ this was the right thing to do.

He did not know the name of the next man, and simply opened his abdomen. Another took his place immediately, and he died too, after one short stroke of his blade. Hans did not know his name, or that of the next, and as they kept coming, even their faces blended together into the same hardened visage. There was no more room for thought. Parry, and thrust. Parry, and slash. Parry, and cut. Only he could maim. Only he could kill. None of the other blades could reach him. One slipup, and this would be over.

Protect Sitron.

Sitron could not fall, because Hans could not fall.

If he fell, he would not get up again.

"Where is Oliver now?" Hans yelled, once he spotted Agdar amidst the battle. Battered and bruised, but, even grounded now that his horse was felled, the Arendellian held his own.

"Safe!" Agdar deflected the points of a slew of pikes skewering for his face, snatching the poles and wrenching them away from the grasp of enemy soldiers. "I moved him away!"

Good. If they survived this day, Oliver would be needed to help run the kingdom. Hans wasted no more of his breath on words, ducking down for safety as Sitron bore them away. He turned his head to the side and spat out a mouthful of blood. Nothing debilitating. Someone had struck him earlier with the flat of a halberd, but nothing broke; Hans had only bit his tongue, and the bleeding would not stop.

Sitron crashed into another rank of soldiers, his armored bulk sufficient to slam against barricades and prevail. Without prompting, the horse spun and kicked out with his hind feet, crushing one man's breastplate and collapsing his chest entirely. Hans took care of the others, cleaving through the weak joints in their armor to sever heads and limbs. Blood spurted from the stumps, and Hans was vaguely glad he took the time to armor Sitron. Wonderful protection against blades, but also blood. Washing it out of his hair would have been a nightmare. Hans winced, though, when Sitron trampled the screaming soldiers underfoot. Cleaning his hooves would be an ordeal anyway.

Hans was interrupted by the sound of thundering hooves, and he immediately turned his head. No other horsemen had been on the battlefield for some time now, and he wondered who could be–

Alek.

Hans ducked only on instinct when Alek raced past, sword swinging for his head, passing so close he heard the whistle of the blade. Another second and he would have been scalped, but there was no sense of fear or relief past his shock. He hardly dared to believe his eyes. He wanted to look away, but the mesmeric sight captured him as much as it horrified. Alek scowled at him from across the field, features drawn as tight as stretched wire, and the expression was familiar – and also not. Even if he always looked irritated, Alek never portrayed such flagrant malevolence.

"Alek!" Hans called, but there was no hint of recognition in his hazed eyes. Alek kicked his horse into a gallop, charging straight for him, and Hans had no choice but to do the same. "What happened–!"

Anna had frozen him, Hans knew that much, and the statue moved elsewhere. What was Alek doing here? Had Anna set him loose? But then, he should not have been driven into this madness…

Dread iced in his veins when Hans realized Alek was driving his horse towards a head-on collision, and he had no intention of stopping. Even if his horse were not larger than Sitron – which the nightmarish beast was, pure black, and hulking over any horse he had ever seen – Hans could not afford to be struck. He veered out of the way, forcing Sitron to overcompensate to keep his balance. Alek capitalized. With one short, compact stroke, he gashed deep into his upper arm.

They rode past one another once again, but this time, Hans clamped his free hand over the wound. It had taken every bit of effort to hold onto his sword, and even now, the numbness overtaking his right arm almost forced him to open his hand. Hans clenched his fist around the handle, his grip slippery with blood, and the strain only made the gash flare with agony – but he could not relent. He turned Sitron around, and saw that Alek had done the same. Another exchange here…would not end in his favor.

"Sitron," Hans murmured, pulling on the reins. Sitron responded by breaking into a dead sprint further inward, toward the castle. Every thud as his hooves impacted the ground seemed to ignite the wound in Hans' arm, splitting the flesh again and again.

Past his watering eyes, Hans looked back to see Alek pursuing. Hans directed his gaze ahead, deflecting the occasional stray slash, but the sight of two charging horses gave even the bravest warrior pause. He passed the ranks of soldiers without incident, though he heard them dying behind him; Alek eviscerated anyone in his way, even the soldiers who fought for the Southern Isles. Well, Hans thought grimly, now he knew what it was like to be hunted.

Hans burst through the main doors and stormed into the empty halls of the castle.

As he took position at one end of the ruined Great Hall, he could not help but mourn the castle. Already weakened and once again shaken by battle, the infrastructure had all but collapsed, leaving dust and rubble to litter the once pristine halls. Marble floors had been upturned, leaving the floors marked with deep schisms. Stone walls had been shattered, leaving great boulders to form a veritable labyrinth.

"We might have time to rebuild," Hans said, while Sitron snorted. In agreement or derision, he could not tell. Perhaps both, Hans thought, and he smiled.

Alek raced into the castle soon enough.

Here, where there was less space to maneuver, Alek was at a disadvantage. Sitron might be agile enough to traverse the wreckage, but Alek's horse was too bulky. His dark beast snarled and yipped, teeth clamping around the air as though he could reach Sitron from across the hall, but Alek himself possessed a quieter fury. Sword practically shattered, the edge chipped and jagged from abuse, Alek tossed the blade aside and drew another with a slow, deliberate motion.

"Why?" Hans asked.

"…Protect…Anna," Alek murmured. "I will…protect Anna…from anyone."

Alek twitched, his face finally showing some semblance of emotion as a spasm shook his body. Even that passed in the next moment, overwritten by an impassive expression. Hans recognized this. Having been put under this spell, he would recognize this anywhere. It was the Sorcerer. Meaning…he must have put Anna under his influence too. Past the horror, it was somewhat gratifying to be proven right.

"We broke out of this once," Hans said. "We can do it again."

Alek raised his sword, and Hans did the same, while their horses scraped the ground with their hooves.

And then they charged.

Hans kept his eyes trained on Alek as the distance closed between them. Whenever Sitron veered, the darker horse would persistently mirror his movement. So Alek was _still_ determined to simply crash into him. Hans pulled Sitron back to a direct path, bending his body forward and watching, waiting, holding his breath as every second brought them closer to a collision. Sitron flicked his ear upward, worried, but Hans murmured for him to wait, and the horse obeyed.

Twenty feet…fifteen feet…ten…five…

Hans _yanked_ on the reins. Sitron leapt to the side, dodging the dark warhorse – Alek swung anyway, his sword cutting through nothing – and Hans flung himself out of the saddle the instant his blow arced away. His momentum sent him crashing into Alek, and tossed them both to the ground.

It hurt when the stones dug into his back, but the worst pain was the fear from knowing he was immobile. Hans grappled with Alek as they rolled amidst the jagged boulders, hands fumbling for purchase, Alek kicking with all his might. An armored boot struck Hans on the shin, crushing his greaves and snapping the bone, and he retaliated by punching Alek across the jaw with all his strength, feeling the bone give way with a crack. While Alek was still stunned, Hans seized him from behind and rolled, holding him back with an arm around his neck. All Hans could hope for was that Alek would faint.

Instead Alek snarled and flung an elbow into his gut, so strongly that Hans choked out blood and bile. Another blow, followed by another that sent black spots spiraling into his vision, but Hans held on with the last shreds of his will – until Alek threw his head back, smashing into his nose.

It broke. Hans let go when his entire skull snapped back, thudding against the ground. Stones might have cut into his head, but he could not feel them. He could not feel much of anything anymore. Faintly, he noticed that Alek was rising to his feet and drawing his sword, preparing to plunge it down. Hans could not feel his fingers. Oh, no, there they were. He inched his hand just an inch to the side, just to see if he could. Yes, he could. And he touched something – something cold – metal.

Hans tightened his grip and stabbed upwards, while Alek stabbed down.

He held the chipped sword Alek had discarded.

It pierced his gut, just as the other blade pierced Hans in the same spot.

Alek uttered a gasp as the sword impaled him, and his hand shot down to clench around the blade. Hans bit back a scream, but he, too, held onto the other blade when he felt Alek trying to pull away.

"Please, Alek," Hans breathed. "Wake up…!"

"I have to…protect…Anna!"

Now Alek dropped his own blade, and both his hands were around the one driven into his stomach. With an enormous heave, screaming with primal fury, he managed to pull himself away by an inch. Slowly, even as Hans applied pressure from the other end, Alek pushed back on the sword. Inch by inch, he slid off the slickened metal.

"You _know_ that thing is not Anna," Hans said, but Alek only shook his head. "Look at me! Look at me – I'm Hans. I know that Anna is important – I care just as much as you do, Alek! But…we…are…brothers. Please, recognize me. You are the only one who ever has, so…please…just please…see me again."

Hans had no more strength. He let his arm fall to the ground. Alek pulled away at last, the momentum sending him stumbling back several feet. As soon as he freed himself, blood gushed out of the puncture, but he paled not because of the wound.

His eyes had lost their feverish glow.

"…Hans?" Alek murmured.

Even after everything, Hans broke into a smile.

And that was when the ceiling collapsed.

Perhaps a stray cannon shot had hit the castle, or perhaps, up above, the battle between the two transcendent beings raged too strongly. With one earth-shattering tremor that shook the foundations of the castle, the ceiling cracked apart. Everything of the upper floors fell upon them, throwing up billows of dust and filth. Furniture, adornments, everything crashed all around him while Hans lay helpless, and he could do nothing but shield himself with his arms. Distantly, he heard Alek shout. When he heard the warning, he looked up and saw a flat slab of stone descending upon him, two meters across and a foot thick. Hans closed his eyes, ready now that he knew he had saved Alek.

When he heard the sound of impact and yet felt nothing, he opened his eyes again.

Alek was bracing the boulder with his back, crouched on one knee as he stared down at Hans. Despite the strain, the veins bulging in his neck, he still managed to smile.

"Not like last time," Alek said, grinning even as his knee buckled and he fell onto both. "I got here on time. I will not – let you – get hurt again."

Roaring, Alek threw off the boulder and shielded Hans with his own body, bending over him as the rubble fell around them. It seemed to be an eternity. Hans could do nothing except apologize, for his weakness and his arrogance, but Alek never said anything and only kept up his smile. Every second that ticked away felt like a lifetime trapped in this living hell, this storm of grey and the tide of rushing rock.

Yet like all things, this, too, passed, and the dust settled around them.

Hans broke into a coughing fit as his body expelled the dust clogged in his lungs. Alek was collapsed atop him, eyes closed and motionless…

…but he was breathing.

Good. Just…good. Not for any other particular reason.

Hans let his head fall back and closed his eyes, smiling.

* * *

Lightning blasted through the wind.

_Why did this happen…?_

Anna flung wicked arcs of lightning with every movement, the wild glee in her eyes reflecting the bright light that seared past again and again. She never once stopped moving, so Elsa could not. She was forced to keep on her feet, always flying at top speed with every ounce of her magic at her heels. Even then, she relied on her automatic defense to hold back the lightning – for a precious fraction of a second before the wall of ice burned and shattered, each fragment of crystal gleaming like flickering lodestars.

_Why are we fighting…?_

"Don't just run," Anna said, licking her lips. With each word, another torrent of lightning ripped from her fingertips. "I want us to hurt each other some more. I want our blood to run together onto these stones. Right here, I want a taste of the real you."

There was no more time for hesitation. She had to act. Elsa spun on her heel and stood her ground, hands outstretched to catch the rushing fury of magic.

Anna broke into wild whoops of laughter as the lightning collided.

Her hands were burning. Fire raced over her skin. Elsa clenched her teeth to keep from screaming, but she kept her hands clenched around the storm of electricity. For that moment, she found herself the helpless child burned by the fire of a furnace once more. She could not move. She was locked into place while Anna stood at the other end, lightning raging all about them as they pushed toward each other in the eye of the storm. It was a hopeless effort. Elsa looked up, feeling that she would soon be torn apart, and saw Anna smiling as she funneled more and more lightning.

She could not win.

Not like this.

Elsa dragged her left arm back, fighting against the pull of the electricity clinging greedily to her skin. She forced open her right hand, fingers uncurling one at a time, so that the lightning now struck her palm – and she stopped fighting. She let the lightning flow through her body, siphoning that enormous energy, feeling it race up her arm with explosive force. It was terrifyingly powerful, almost intoxicating; but still hers, then and now. Elsa thrust her left hand forward and _pushed_ the lightning out again.

It struck Anna dead in the chest.

Instantly, the storm extinguished. Anna was picked up off her feet and thrown away. She struck the ground, hard, and rolled helplessly. Stopping at the edge, Anna lay there spread-eagled, head tilted back and limbs bent at unnatural angles. She did not speak. She made no sound. But once Elsa began to hope this was the end – Anna laughed. She propped herself up on one arm, bones straightening with hideous pops and cracks, and the cuts on her face and lip closed. Once her finger wiped away the blood on her face, she could have never been injured at all.

"Isn't this…just the best, Elsa? To think that you could really hurt me like this!" Anna breathed out a throaty chuckle. "You're happy too, right? Hurting together with the one you love most?"

"What you feel right now is the furthest thing from love."

"Let me prove it to you, then."

Anna traced a vicious arc across the air with her arm, and lightning came rushing at her once more. Elsa knew how to deal with the lightning now, powerful though it was, and her hand rose to meet it and absorb the magic. In an instant the crackling energy phased out, and her palm glowed white, showing the reflection of a storm that no longer existed. Then her hand slashed downward and the lightning was redirected, knocking Anna backwards…but she stayed on her feet.

She shouted _something_ as she counterattacked, but Elsa could not hear her over the shrill screech of electricity. Both of them were hurling lightning as fast as they could. They seized the other's magic and flung that back as well, volleying the electricity between them so it grew stronger and stronger, and the magic finally built to a crescendo. It lost all form. There was no longer lightning but pure magic, pure white, so intense that Elsa could barely tolerate being in its presence, let alone hope to _use_ it.

The Southern Isles trembled beneath them.

"Beautiful…" Anna murmured, but her voice rose and she said again, shouting, "Elsa, I feel alive again!"

But Elsa was at her limit, and she knew better than to engage in a direct contest of strength.

She broke off the exchange of magic and ensconced herself behind the strongest barriers she could manage. Just in time. All at once, the immeasurable magic collapsed. Standing there at the epicenter of the blast was like witnessing the death of a star, white fire, soundless energy. Elsa continuously repaired her barriers, pushing every ounce of her power into maintaining a small protection from what was certain death. Even then, her ice was obliterated as quickly as its creation. Even behind the layers and layers of walls, Elsa was blinded by the flash of white that threatened to consume all her senses.

It faded, though, slowly. It was like the world being created again when sensation returned.

Elsa let down the wall, and Anna was there.

Lightning again, pouring from her hands as they slashed the air without rhyme or reason. Elsa dodged all the stray bolts, feeling the heat of some fan across her face, noting that others struck far from where she stood. She stayed one step ahead of Anna, retreating until she could regain her balance. There were holes everywhere in Anna's defense. Now Elsa weaved through the lightning, taking slow but deliberate steps into the electrical storm, and at last she dropped all pretenses, and charged. Anna was in the midst of another attack when Elsa reached out, and seized her wrist.

There was a bright flash of light as the magic in Anna's hand erupted, and for the first time since the battle began, Anna shouted in pain. She recoiled, and Elsa let go of her wrist – Anna stumbled backwards, distracted enough that she did not notice, did not react, when Elsa flung her hand forward.

Ice tore into her side, slicing through her armor and releasing a spray of blood.

_Keep attacking._

_Don't stop to think, or you'll hesitate._

Like that, the flow of the battle changed. Elsa was no longer the one pushed back, the one forced to defend. Elsa whipped her hand and Anna was once again too slow. Ice cut into her again, spilling dark blood from her upper arm. She shrieked in pain and lashed out reflexively; Elsa redirected the lightning without a thought. Another attempt. Elsa closed her hand around her wrist and forced more magic into the budding spell. Once again the lightning erupted, more violently this time, and Anna pushed her back with a furious yell. Elsa's feet left the ground and she crashed against the tower, but she was fine.

Anna looked crazed. An entire corner of her face was awash with blood and hair had been scattered, more of the white now draped with red. Her armor had been burned and blackened, scored deeply so that there was nothing left of the pristine image of before. Even her cape had fluttered away. Anna was panting, and when she wiped the blood from her face, more trickled down.

"Why…?" Anna murmured.

"You are more powerful than me now…but you will lose."

Anna looked at her with wide, uncomprehending eyes.

"Edmund would have won against me," Elsa said.

She could see that Anna still did not understand. How strange it was, to be on the other side of this dynamic! Anna thought she could not lose, because she had a greater portion of her heart. She was powerful but she fought with brute force, always using the same violent, shortsighted attacks as though she could simply overwhelm her with power alone. Except…Elsa had a lifetime of experience fighting the exact same way, and the memory of someone countering her perfectly.

Anna bared her teeth and fired another bolt of electricity.

Elsa plunged her hands into the lightning, and launched it back.

Anna gasped once when she was struck, as she was carried through the air by the impact. It seemed to take an eternity for her to fall. Her limbs slackened like broken wings, and for a moment she hung in space, suspended, as though gravity itself could not impinge on her majesty. But the moment passed. With a crash louder than any lightning or thunderclap, Anna crashed to the ground.

"It's over now," Elsa murmured.

And that was when the Mirror glowed.

Elsa had forgotten about it until now. Its surface glowed with luminosity befitting the moon. A column of pale white light burst forth and pierced high into the heavens until, with an earth-shattering roar that would echo through the world, the light radiated outwards in all directions. All the rays of light stretched on and on, blanketing all under its perfect illumination. Such force emanated from the Mirror that the entire earth seemed to shake. An unbearable cold descended where the light touched, chilling even Elsa to the bone, past the bone and past the confines of her body. She felt this cold seize her soul.

"You didn't notice," Anna said.

Elsa whipped her head towards her fallen form. Anna was still lying there, but she had her eyes covered behind one hand as she laughed quietly, body shaking with barely suppressed mirth.

Sometime during their battle, the snowstorm had ceased.

Not only that, but the snowflakes hung suspended in midair as though even the storm was frozen. Gases had condensed, filling the air with viscous globes of liquid. Bits of stone had broken off the tower and were now simply hanging there, crackling with electricity that never seemed to diminish. All the laws of nature were being warped because of this terrible cold.

"What's happening?" Elsa asked.

"Eternal winter…and oblivion."

* * *

Hans shifted.

Even that was torturous, but not because of any pain in his body. Actually, he could not feel much of anything at all. His arms and legs tingled as though they were asleep. Strangely, there was silence. Had the battle ended? But he could hear nothing at all. Not silence but absolute quiet, because even in silence, there should have been something. Even the deaf could feel vibrations, but here, and now, there was nothing. Hans barely even felt his own existence. He could not speak any words, hear any sounds, or smell any smells.

But he felt some movement that he realized was the turning of the earth. It was the world rotating on its axis, travelling its inexorable course around the sun. It was a buoy not unlike floating on the waters of the ocean, caught in the ebb and flow of the tides. Perhaps they were, all of them, swept in the swell of the waves, pulled by the tug of the moon. What were they but insignificant creatures in the face of this supreme celestial power?

It was a terrifying sensation, to be so reduced.

Hans pushed himself upright, lost all sensation in his limbs, and when he looked outside to what had once been a raging battle, he witnessed the impending end.

All the people had been frozen.

It was a mausoleum of crystal statues. Morbidly beautiful, perhaps, the way the last rays of light reflected off their surface and fell again in a shower of colors. For one moment, Hans wanted to believe these were merely statues, they had never been people, but there was a realism here that not even Elsa or Anna could have imitated. Not one person had been spared, whether young or old, man or woman. All of them were trapped within a prison of ice, mouths agape with horror as they no doubt realized their last moments. Were they _still_ aware? Hopefully not. Hopefully…

What hope was there?

And this would spread.

Radiate outwards from the Southern Isles, until the entire world fell into this unending purgatory.

Now, Hans too began to feel the insidious cold overtaking his senses. It was a surreal horror to feel the sensation of the world fading around him. Ice trickled through his veins, not painfully cold but persistent, freezing his blood, agony and loneliness and resignation all at once. His mind was slowing, too. Fog fell over his thoughts, and bit by bit, his memories fell away to nothingness.

Mamma died her second death, forgotten.

Anna passed into a distant corner of his mind, bright but faceless.

Alek faded, too, lost forever in the thickening fog.

When Hans looked at the unconscious body beside him, he could not recognize that face, and he could not remember a name. Try as he might, he could not remember him. Should he know that face? Hans felt like he should, but…nothing. And he was so tired. His eyelids fell, slowly.

Until what remained of the world darkened, swallowed into the abyss of eternal sleep.

* * *

She was witnessing the end of the world.

Elsa wanted to laugh, or maybe to cry, that Anna would be the one to put an end to the world. Anna, who had believed in faith and compassion, who had been nothing but good and kind, who had always seen the best in others. Now, Anna would end everything. She did not deserve to be used for something so heinous. She did not deserve any of this madness. To see the face of the woman she loved swallowed by an utter abyss of despair and hope, Elsa wanted only the gift to bear this alone.

"Please, Edmund. Stop this," Elsa said.

"You'll be my desire for the rest of eternity," Anna said, as though Elsa had not spoken. She rose to her feet with a languid motion, grinning, head lolling back like a discarded puppet. "We might even survive this cold, the two of us. If you won't give yourself to me, we will be two immortals, locked in the loving embrace of battle for the rest of time."

"It won't come to that."

"Strong words!" Anna giggled and clapped her hands. "Are you maybe…underestimating me? But you were right, I was fighting too sloppily. I'm sorry I disappointed you. I was too excited, I forgot myself."

"We don't have to fight," Elsa said.

"But then…what else would we do?"

It began again.

Bounding off the ground into a powerful jump, Anna spun into a perfect butterfly kick. Her legs swung through the air, one after the other, and magic slashed down with the arc of her limbs. Not just magic, not the mindless display of lightning. What came at her now was _snow_. Elsa lurched away, allowing her automatic defense to manifest. Snow struck the ice walls powerfully, but not enough to shatter them. Enough to cloud her vision. Anna landed on her feet and dashed, even before the snow had cleared. Elsa could not see, let alone react.

Anna bent her knees and leapt, completely flipping over the wall.

It was such an astonishing feat of acrobatics that Elsa was too stunned to even whirl around. Anna landed behind her, behind the protective wall. Nothing protected her now. Anna seized the back of her neck and slammed her face-first into her own ice wall; Elsa bit back a groan when she felt her nose crack and her lip split against the diamond-like structure, but she was still aware enough to summon stalactites that speared from the wall. Anna let go and jumped back, while Elsa wiped away the blood and drew upon her magic to heal her torn lip, and her nose straightened so she could breathe.

But the effort taxed her badly.

"I knew you wouldn't succumb so easily," Anna said. "If you did, I would never forgive you."

"Will you listen to nothing that I have to say?" Elsa asked.

"We are long past words. But then, we never needed them." Anna shook her head, snorting softly. Her laugh was a bitter thing. "Words are meaningless. Just arbitrary sounds, Elsa. What I am saying to you now, even, and everything that I ever said to you before. Meaningless. Everything…comes too late."

"Anna never said anything that she didn't mean. She might not have always needed to hear those same things from me…but she knew their importance." Elsa smiled. Try as she might, she did pity him, the boy whose fate could have been her own. "You are talking about Gustaf. Aren't you…Edmund?"

Anna lost her smile.

"Enough with the names already."

Anna swung her leg around again, unleashing blast after blast of ice. Elsa matched her movements, flinging her hands and launching bursts of snow. In the space between them, ice and snow collided time after time; but Anna did not stand idle. She cartwheeled out of the way and glided forward again, explosive jets of cold air propelling her movements. Ice blossomed above her palm, spiraling into a helical spear ending at a wicked point.

Elsa dragged her hands upward, and Anna flung the spear forward.

It struck her wall and punched out an ever-widening circular hole, drilling through an entire two feet; but the wall constricted and soon the spear stopped, melted, and was reformed into another layer of the wall of ice. Elsa barely had time to breathe before Anna caught up. Nothing complicated. She simply drew back her hand and stabbed. Anna should not have been strong enough to punch through, and she was not; Elsa watched with mingled horror and awe when the ice _morphed_ to allow her passage, stretching back as though it were elastic. Anna closed her hand into a fist, and lightning crashed throughout the ice until it exploded in a shower of crystals.

Shards landed at her feet, and Elsa rolled across them to avoid the furious onslaught of lightning that now struck the space she had occupied. All at once, they stopped. Elsa looked up when a shadow passed over her eyes, and Anna was there, leaping down with an ice blade extending off her arm. She leapt aside; Anna stabbed deep into the ground, and using that as leverage, she swung herself around, kicking furiously. Elsa jerked away, but as soon as the boot was level with her face, ice speared off the end like a hidden blade and sliced deep across her cheek.

Anna laughed.

Blood welled from the cut, and the sting numbed part of her face; but there was no time to heal. Elsa seized Anna's leg and flung her away, snapping the blade of ice that kept her grounded. Anna let loose an exhilarated whoop as she sailed through the air, bending her knees and shifting into a controlled flip. At the apex of her flight, there appeared a platform of ice – Anna landed firmly, kicked off the platform, and slammed back down. Two jagged walls of ice tore through the ground where she landed, flinging shrapnel haphazardly. Elsa dodged what she could, her hand snaking out to take control of the rest, and the jagged shards halted mid-motion. With a thought, she sent them back.

Anna glided away, flying across the ice that flowed from her feet. Lightning began to surround her form. Even while Elsa fired off small arcs of snow, jagged bolts of electricity flickered off the web and struck them down. Elsa skid away from her trajectory, dodging her every attempt to close the distance between them. They were both moving at breakneck speeds. Elsa pushed herself to her limit, driven on by the feeling of Anna following her with a burning gaze.

All the while, they threw bolts of magic back and forth. Anna summoned an avalanche of snow and sent it rushing forward; Elsa moved her arms in a circle, entire body twisting in tandem with the motion, and the wave redirected to her side, rolled around her back, and was sent surging at Anna again. She stamped her foot and the snow erupted upwards, toweringly tall, like an ocean that hung above their heads. Anna seemed content to be crushed together with Elsa. As the snow fell, uncontrolled, she began her mad dash again. Elsa gritted her teeth and took control of the avalanche, feeling the strain in her muscles as surely as if she were physically carrying the mountain of snow. She curved it off the edge of the tower, but it cost her time, precious time.

Anna leapt forward and punched.

With the slightest motion of her fingers, Elsa sent two tendrils of snow to wrap around Anna's arm and leg, dragging her down. She wasn't even slowed. Balancing on her fingertips, she flipped upright again and brought her leg crashing down into an axe-kick.

It drove deep into Elsa's shoulder, and the bone snapped with a sickening crack.

Elsa screamed.

Even her collarbone had been broken. Elsa fell down to one knee, but the pain granted her a desperate strength. Lightning pushed Anna back. Whether she was truly overwhelmed or simply satisfied, Elsa did not care to think about. As soon as there was some space between them, Elsa clutched her useless left arm, trying not to think about what she would have to do.

"Pity that you heal slower than me," Anna said, as though she could read her mind. "Now then, are you ready to give in to me, or do we need to keep–?"

Elsa shoved the bone back into place.

She could _feel_ her bones scraping together. There was just no more time to wait – Anna raised her eyebrows, but Elsa bit her tongue to keep from screaming again while her magic did the rest. Even now, she straightened her back and stared at Anna in defiance. She would not look away. Seeing that face – the face of the woman she loved, worn like a mask and paraded like a trophy, used to laugh at her pain – seeing her brought greater torment than anything done to her body; but Elsa would not look away.

"Are you done?" Elsa asked.

Anna looked stupefied for a moment before she brightened.

"Let's make this more interesting."

Anna snapped her arm out. Flames leapt into existence as she brought her _third_ element into play, and this was nothing like fighting the Sorcerer or even Markus. An enormous wave of blue fire surged across the ground, fueled without substance, large enough to dwarf her completely. Elsa braced herself and leapt upwards, clasping her hands together and bringing all her magic to the point of her fingers. She slashed down with all her might, and the arc of white light pushed into the flames. It parted the wave. Two halves of blue fire passed harmlessly, and Elsa raced towards Anna before she could hope to move.

Her form burst into shadows.

Elsa spun around as Anna circled the circumference of the tower and then took flight, the shadowy mass streaking down again shaped as a bird of prey. It folded in its wings and corkscrewed through the air when Elsa whipped a tendril of snow for the vulnerable limbs, practically taunting her with a shrill shriek. She could do nothing to stop this. All she managed was to avoid the direct hit, as the shadow impacted the ground and blasted outwards in an explosion of flame.

Even then, Elsa was picked up and thrown like a ragdoll, feeling the heat fan across her skin.

She rolled on the ground and only stopped when she hit the edge with her back, feeling her breath knocked away. And worse, replaced by the fumes of the fire. Elsa coughed, spitting out a dark mixture of blood and tar and ash. Her skin had been scalded and left with angry burns, but the burns were a welcome thing. Patches of skin had been blackened entirely, completely deadened.

"Are you satisfied now?" Anna asked. She reformed, but while the shadows stretched into the familiar form of her body, while she was still swathed in the darkness, she resembled...

"Wraith," Elsa murmured.

Anna stilled.

"What did you call me?"

"Wraith is what the trolls called people like us," Elsa said, smiling. Anna narrowed her eyes and she clarified, "People without their heart."

"You're wrong." Anna drew a deep breath, but even from a distance, Elsa could see the corded muscles in her neck. She looked away, and hissed through clenched teeth. "I do have a heart."

"Is that heart yours?"

Anna did not speak.

"I didn't think you would be willing to use shadow magic against me," Elsa continued. Her wounds were not healing. Her magic was blocked by the foul, burning touch of the shadows, but she was not concerned. "Considering that it was Markus who taught you, Edmund."

Anna jerked her head to one side, but the motion seemed involuntary. She began pacing, but Elsa saw the odd tics running through her face, the twitching of her hands. Her mouth turned into an ugly frown.

"I already told you to call me Anna."

"I refuse to call you by that name," Elsa said, and Anna clenched her jaw shut. "It doesn't belong to you. You might have stolen her body and even her mind, but you do not deserve that name."

Elsa rose, breathing deeply, heavily injured, and Anna stood there on the other end. She was practically untouched. Any injury she might have sustained earlier had healed completely, leaving only evidence on her battered armor and perhaps the dried blood at the corner of her forehead. But somehow, Elsa didn't feel like she was losing. Instead, she felt completely in control. Anna seemed to get angrier with every second that passed, so enraged she could not even speak. Elsa did not see any threat here.

Was this how Edmund had felt when they fought so long ago?

"I do not need you to tell me my worth," Anna said quietly.

"No," Elsa agreed. "Only you can decide that."

"Are you patronizing me?"

Elsa shook her head.

"If I were to patronize you," Elsa said, "I would become a hypocrite. But I don't think that we really are beyond words. You might think that words are meaningless, but…I would speak to you, if you will listen."

"I will not," Anna said. "Anything you have to say to me, I don't care. If you still think that you can change my mind, that you can save me, then I will _break_ you."

Elsa had expected nothing less.

She would have done the same, once.

"Try me, then."

Elsa held out her hand, molding her magic as she had not since her gift was turned to destruction. It was some comfort to her now. Ice flowed into the form of a sword, and Elsa held it out in challenge.

"Fine," Anna murmured. Ice coalesced into a rapier that hovered in the air. Anna seized it in her hand, flicking its blade outward in a violent motion. "If this is what you want, Elsa, then I will kill you."

Anna slashed viciously at the air, and arcs of lightning flew from the tip. Elsa batted them aside and closed the distance between them, slamming her blade against hers. Again and again she swung, but each time, Anna still managed to deflect it with her rapier, altering its path with the slightest, most precise touch. There was no enjoyment in her face now. She wanted this to end, too.

"When I was at Baaj," Elsa said, "I saw your reliquary, and I saw your memories."

Anna swung upwards, too hard, and the momentum of her swing left her wide open. Elsa dipped under her arm, reached out, and gently laid a hand on her chest.

It went against her every instinct.

Elsa let loose a torrent of lightning.

Anna made a strangled noise and stumbled backwards, swinging mindlessly as though she could shake off the currents of electricity that ran through her body. At last, she doubled over and stopped, panting.

"I'm sure you saw many things," Anna said, her voice little more than a demented snarl. She raised her head and straightened, eyes spitting her fury. "But none of them are related to me."

"Why did you send me to Baaj, then?"

"It was an accident," Anna said, but her hand shook, her sword rattled and scarred the ground. "I never meant to send you anywhere. I was trying to kill you."

"It was _not_ an accident," Elsa retorted. "I could not have ended up there on accident, not when the entire island has been warped by your pain! You _wanted_ me there."

"Why?" Anna demanded. "If you are so sure, then tell me. Why would I want to send you there, to that place, that – that – that disgusting hovel, that graveyard, that place–? Why would I want…?"

Anna seemed beyond words. She threw herself forward again, slashing maniacally, and each time, Elsa only needed to take a careful step back to avoid the wide swings. At last, Elsa trapped their blades together and pushed, once again throwing Anna off balance.

"Because you wanted me to see just what you had gone through," Elsa continued. "Because we are so much alike, and you wanted me to understand your suffering, to share your pain. Am I right…Edmund?"

Anna said nothing.

"I regained part of my heart because of you," Elsa said. "When I saw what happened to you, I learned about myself too. I spoke to my heart…I spoke to my younger self, the part of me that I had thrown away. You can do it too. We can't live our lives for other people, Edmund. We can't make ourselves into something that we are not. We have to be…us. Let go, Edmund. It's not such a terrible thing."

Anna was breathing breaths too shallow, too quickly. An unfathomable rage had possessed her body, too powerful to be released. Anna clutched her chest with her free hand, looking torn between screaming and attacking, until finally she began to speak.

"Arrogance," Anna said.

She sounded choked and strangled. Her entire body shook. Her hand, closed around her sword, dropped the blade and clenched into a tight fist, until her nails dug into her palms and blood dripped through the cracks of her fingers. Such a wave of pure force expelled itself from her being that the air currents themselves rippled and tore. Elsa raised her arm to shield her eyes from the buffeting wind, the keening and mewling growing ever louder in her ears even as the air sliced into her skin.

"You don't know anything!" Anna screamed.

She jerked her head so violently that her hair unraveled and swept into a billow of silver-grey. Whatever sanity was left had vanished. Her expression twisted with an inhuman rage, the muscles and veins pulsing as black lines spidered across her face. Her skin had lost the unearthly luminosity, and took on an ashen pallor that resembled a corpse. Anna screamed and fell to her knees, hand tightening around her chest.

"Do you think you're better than me? You're no different. You – are – worse! I told you before I might be a shell – but you – you are a puppet. Even now, you parrot the wisdom of the trolls, as though you expect me to hear your drivel and be forever changed. Do you think because you regained some small piece of your heart that you can lord your superiority over me? You are nothing. You were always nothing, and you will always be nothing! Did you _really_ have any choice but to reassure that girl, promise her anything? It was only because you wanted to live. It was only because you wanted to come back here, _and save Anna!_"

Anna sprang to her feet and the rapier reappeared in her hand. Her free arm settled behind her back in a classic fencer's stance, and she pushed forward, rapier flashing bright. Her assault was blindingly fast, so fast that Elsa could barely keep up. Ice sliced into her arms, her sides, her legs. Fire flooded into her wounds, boiled her blood. Lightning ripped her skin, seared her flesh.

But she knew her pain was nothing compared to this poor creature.

"It's true, I love Anna," Elsa said, quietly, but she knew Anna heard, because she only redoubled her assault. "And I thought her smile had always saved me, and I want to save her now. But, Edmund…I never lied to my heart. It's impossible."

"_What – are – you – saying?_"

"I love Anna, but…" Elsa smiled. "I don't need her to be whole. I'm not looking for her to fill the void anymore. It was never fair for either of us. I love Anna, I want to be with her, but not because I need her to hold me up – I want to be next to her, as I stand on my own."

Anna screamed. Her hand shot out from behind her back, and Elsa could do nothing when she caught the blade of her sword. Her gauntlet shattered from the effort but Anna gripped the sword firmly, all else forgotten in her single-minded desire for blood. She drew back her rapier…and stabbed Elsa.

Ice pierced her chest, and stabbed her heart.

Elsa clenched her hand around the ice, but she felt no pain. Anna's gaze immediately went to the sword in her other hand, but Elsa had no intention of attacking. She would not fight anymore. Not Anna…

Not Edmund.

"I can accept myself now. I am, and I always have been, Elsa."

"Stop talking," Anna said.

"Forgive me, Edmund, but I want to talk to Anna just this once." Elsa moved from the blade to seize Anna's hand, even as she frantically tried to pull away. Ice bound them together now. Elsa closed her eyes, and let herself dream just for this second that everything was as it had once been, that _they_ were as they had once been. "I'm not sure if you can hear me, Anna, but I want you to know...I am grateful we met. Even if you can't be my heart, you are always in it. You give me hope."

"Just stop talking, stop, stop, stop–!"

"But you," Elsa said, opening her eyes and allowing her pity to fade, her anger at this travesty to resurface, and Anna met her gaze with wide, panicked eyes that never focused on her face. "Look what _you_ have become. You are more lost now than you ever were. You've thrown everything away, but to what end? You are everything you despised. You became a puppet. You are more Markus' than Gustaf's son now, Edmund."

Anna's gaze sharpened.

Her pupils were no longer blue, but black.

"My name…is_…Odon!_"

Her sword shattered in her hand.

Anna screamed, but she was not alone. Overlapping her voice was a second, male, howling with furious denial and cheated rage, pain and despair that burned raw. Her bloodless face swelled with color and even the white of her hair receded, drawing back like a veil to reveal the red underneath. Anna gasped, eyes flitting to and fro with horror and fear and dread. She tried to say something, but her head snapped back, and Anna let loose another desperate scream.

Light burst from her chest, bending her body with the force of its emergence.

"No!" Anna scrabbled to hold onto the light, but her shaking hands barely moved. "No! No – Elsa! How are you doing this – I am – I am – I am perfect, I am whole now. You cannot take this from me–!"

Elsa already knew what was happening.

Before her eyes, the light coalesced into the form of a snowflake, and ripped out of Anna.

She stilled, mouth agape but soundless like a doll without a ventriloquist, teetering on her feet like a puppet with cut strings, as though she had not yet registered the truth of what had happened.

Hovering there in front of them was her heart, and the desperate scream still echoed – but not from Anna. Shadows clung to the snowflake like a layer of grime, screeching its agony, but the light of her heart could not be masked. It pulsed, once, and the darkness was expelled. Elsa did not need to reach out. Her heart returned of its own accord, phasing back into her body. It filled the wound in her chest and soothed her pains with warmth, but what comforted her was nothing physical. It was song that echoed in her soul. Even in the depth of winter, there still lay within her an invincible summer.

She was whole again. Not only having her heart back, but she was truly, at long last, at peace.

And Anna, the _real_ Anna, stood in front of her now.

Her eyes fluttered to a close, and she staggered.

Elsa rushed ahead and caught her as she fell, hardly daring to believe she had succeeded. Would Anna forever slumber, and never wake? Or would she wake, and attack her again? Elsa fell to the ground and held Anna close. Elsa clutched her tightly while she still could. She couldn't be sure she would have this chance again. Gleaming like a beacon amidst the storm of white, the Mirror had neither dimmed nor weakened. Perhaps the end was truly inevitable. If this was to be her last moment before oblivion, Elsa could have no greater happiness than to hold Anna in her arms.

"E-Elsa…?"

Anna opened her eyes, and they were not rimmed with red, but the warm shade of blue that Elsa had known before. Recognition. She could see her now. She knew who she was. Elsa reached out with a shaking hand, unable to let herself believe until she felt the warmth of her cheek. Anna was really here.

Elsa broke into a smile.

"It's me," Elsa said.

_It's you. It's really you, Anna._

"I-I'm so sorry I hurt you," Anna said, barely audible behind the muffling of her sobs. Tears fell from the corner of her eyes. Elsa shook her head, trying to tell her that she was unhurt, she was fine, but Anna would not relent. "I'm so, so sorry, Elsa. I-I could see everything happening but I couldn't stop myself, I couldn't do anything but I swear I tried–"

"I know," Elsa said. She pulled Anna close, feeling her tremor against her body. She thought she had known pain. Nothing could compare to what she felt when she saw Anna so scared; not scared of anything, but scared of herself. None of this should have happened to Anna. "None of it was your fault."

"No, Elsa. I-I wanted to, to heal you, to fix you somehow," Anna said, grasping her hand almost desperately. "I wanted to be your heart. Otherwise…this wouldn't have happened. Do you get that?"

"I don't blame you," Elsa said. She brushed away Anna's tears with her thumb, feeling the warmth of her skin and somehow unable to keep from crying too. "We just have things to learn, both of us. We aren't..." Elsa swallowed. "We aren't perfect. But we…we will get through this."

_I will always love you._

Wisps of shadow – the same shadow that had escaped from Anna and been banished from her heart – squirmed in the air with a keening wail. Elsa and Anna watched as the darkness slowly descended, bleeding together like patchwork, and aggregate into a familiar form that fell like a black teardrop.

Edmund lay on the ground not ten feet away, broken.

Deserted by her reliquary and without protection from the cold that he had unleashed, his face was now pale and bloodless, skin cracked, eyes rimmed by red and lips colorless. Edmund made no coherent sounds, save for low moans of an unyielding pain. Though he curled inwards, one arm held tight against his chest, his free hand still extended, shaking, towards them – Anna flinched, releasing the tiniest gasp of a breathless terror. Elsa shifted so she shielded Anna from him.

"M-My heart," Edmund said, and his teeth chattered, his eyes squeezed shut as another wave of agony tore through his ravaged body. Elsa knew his anguish well, the pain of separation and the horror of loss. He could not have much time left before his reliquary crumbled away. Without hers, he would die soon.

"You don't have to do this," Elsa said, and Edmund turned, eyes snapping open with jealous hatred. "You don't have to live like this, Edmund. Before your time runs out, try, try and accept who you are–"

"You don't know anything," Edmund hissed, managing to crawl less than a foot before pain overcame his rage. "You have _always_ had everything, and I – _I have nothing left_."

Edmund seized in yet another spasm. Blood dripped from his eyes and his nostrils. Blackened veins crawled their way up his neck, spreading to his chin, and his head and limbs jerked with spastic motions.

"Please, Elsa," Anna said, slowly, reluctantly drawing away. Though she was still afraid when she looked at Edmund, she still had the spark of her old determination. "Let me talk to him."

"Are you sure?"

"We were…the same person, for a while," Anna said, eyes squeezing shut, looking sick and feverish as the memories no doubt resurfaced. Elsa gripped her hand. "So I…I can understand."

"You don't have to do this," Elsa said.

"I-I want to help."

"Can you forgive him?"

"I don't know," Anna said, but she looked at him and there was still pity in her eyes. "All I know is that we were friends, and I…I don't want to see him like this."

Anna pushed herself onto her feet, nearly collapsing from that alone. Somehow she made her way across the platform. Elsa watched carefully, ready to intervene; but she doubted she would be needed.

"Edmund," Anna said, though he hardly seemed to notice. "I know that you're suffering. I know that the world has been unfair to you. It's not a reason, Edmund. You have to make your own choices, and I know you want to make the right ones. Please, just…let go."

"I already let go," Edmund choked.

"Not of yourself, but…the pain," Anna said. "I know you hate feeling broken, so you wrapped yourself in the pain. Let it go, Edmund. It was your shield, but you have to let go."

Edmund opened his mouth to speak, and at that moment, the Mirror released one final pulse of energy. It shook the entire world. Elsa looked up in alarm as the winter began to reach its climax, as the cold reached its zenith and the world below began to give way to nothing. Her hands were starting to numb. When she lifted them, she saw the ice building over her skin, the cold that overtook her blood. No one else could have survived. Right now, Elsa knew, the only people still awake were them three.

They were all that was left.

Edmund threw his head back and broke into raucous laughter, choking out ragged breaths between.

"My will is done regardless," Edmund said, pointing up at the Mirror. "It doesn't matter who holds your heart, Elsa. You can have it back! Completing it only sped up the process. If this is something that can be stopped, then just try. It's already too late."

Elsa drew the Mirror towards herself, and the artifact, though now under her control, had already unleashed too much power to be withdrawn. It was complete now, truly complete, with her heart supplying it with its full might. Edmund spoke the truth. Nothing could be done.

"I have saved everyone," Edmund breathed. "I have given everyone eternal happiness."

"Happiness is nothing like this!" Anna said.

But Edmund only laughed.

"There has to be a way," Anna said, but one look at her face and Elsa knew that was a lie. And Anna would know. She had been one with Edmund. "Elsa, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, about everything–"

"Anna," Elsa said. "Can you come here?"

It took a precious second for Anna to realize what had been asked, and Elsa smiled softly at her confusion. It was very much like Anna. She stepped closer as though each one was dangerous. One step, and then two, and then three. Her steps quickened, and finally Anna flung herself into Elsa's arms.

"Enough with the apologies, Anna," Elsa murmured. She pressed a kiss to the top of her head. "You don't always have to say sorry. I'm grateful."

"Please, stop. Please don't say goodbye."

"What the trolls told me was that the Mirror can only be broken by someone who let go of all their desires," Elsa said, and Anna tightened her embrace. "But I know I can't do that, and…I don't think that's really such a bad thing. I meant everything I said before. I want to stand beside you."

"I-I know," Anna choked out. "I do too."

"And that's why…I can't let go. I never want to let go of you."

Elsa drew away from their embrace, desperately missing its warmth the moment they were separated. But that was fine. Elsa took a moment to study Anna's face, to commit her every feature to memory, as though she had not already done so. She didn't like to see Anna crying. She wished she hadn't been the reason for all the times Anna had cried, but here she was, giving her yet another reason.

_Anna, I'm sorry._

Elsa cupped her face, and kissed Anna one more time.

"Because I love you," Elsa breathed. "I never stopped, and I never will."

"Y-You finally said it aloud," Anna said, laughing and sobbing.

Elsa looked back, where the Mirror was beginning its final revolution. Just behind, Edmund was watching them. His eyes were wide, questioning, and when their gazes met for a brief instant, just before he looked away, she thought he had seen her unspoken answer. Either way, any time she had left would be for Anna. Elsa turned back, smiling, because this, the last moment of her life, was somehow the happiest too.

"Are you afraid?" Elsa asked.

"Yes," Anna said. "I am. I-I'm afraid for you."

Elsa kissed Anna again, tasting salt on her lips, but this time would be the last. When she drew back this time, she would not allow herself to reach out again. If she did, she might never have the strength to leave. She would let herself be selfish. When Anna reached for her hand, Elsa stepped away and brought the Mirror with her to their own space. She shook her head at Anna's unspoken question. Would it be selfish to close her eyes? She couldn't bear to see the hurt and desperation in Anna's gaze.

"I am the human reincarnation of the Mirror," Elsa said. "Its magic is my own. I might not be able to make it stop, and I might not be able to break it, but…I can still absorb all this."

She could truly become one with the Mirror and take in all of its magic, take in all of this power that it had already unleashed. It would reverse the winter. But…Elsa was only human. She would not survive, not with her frail, mortal body, and she already knew what would happen. She would freeze. She would be forever enshrined within a cocoon of crystal, ageless, perfect, alone. She would never wake.

And that was fine, because Elsa could not imagine any world without Anna.

Every second that counted down now was counting down on her life.

"No!" Anna made to dash forward, but Elsa forced herself to be cruel. Ice rose between them, and Anna had no power to break through it now. She slammed her fists against the wall, doing nothing, and Elsa wished her ice was opaque. She did not want this to be her last memory. Still, she didn't look away. She still wanted to see Anna. "No! You can't do this – I did this, I can be the one to – Elsa! Listen to me!"

Anna sank down to her knees.

Elsa barely noticed.

She couldn't hear Anna so well anymore.

She couldn't see Anna so well anymore.

Elsa could only feel the cold overtake her every sensation, but before that, she whispered one thing.

"Goodbye, Anna."

* * *

Why were they so unhappy?

Edmund thought he had given them a boon. Oblivion was his salvation for this diseased world of false hope and hypocrisy. It was rotten to the core, doomed to despair and failure. There was nothing of worth. What was in this world that could be treasured? But here they were, and they were not happy. Anna was crying. Elsa was smiling, but her smile held nothing but sadness. Edmund did not understand.

Why were they sad about separation?

Edmund shifted his gaze to Anna. Anna was perfect. Anna was everything that he aspired to be. For one glorious moment, he had achieved that pinnacle of existence. Before it was ripped from him, and he was told he had been wrong. What was so wrong with wanting to be someone else? Anna was more perfect than he could ever hope to be.

And yet here she was, crying.

Edmund shifted his gaze to Elsa. Elsa was imperfect. Elsa was everything that he despised. Whenever he looked at her face, he was reminded of his failures. She reminded him of the time he was stupid enough to gleam any hope at all from his miserable existence, and she was even worse than him. She was just a puppet dancing on strings.

And yet here she was, so sure, so strong, that…

Edmund began to doubt.

"Please, Elsa," Anna sobbed, and Edmund heard the one thing he had never wanted to hear in her voice. It was despair blacker than hell. Even more than his own, and he could not understand.

_Why are you so sad…?_

_What…makes you…sad…?_

_Do you feel sad…because…you…care…?_

People felt sad because they cared, which brought up the question of why people bothered caring at all; and Edmund remembered the look that Elsa had given him. She had already told him. She was happy. She was happy because she cared, because she loved. But then…everything he had done…?

Edmund wished Gustaf was still here to answer his questions.

_Father… Was I wrong?_

* * *

Anna watched helplessly as Elsa crystallized.

Elsa stood calmly. She showed no trace of fear for her fate, leaving only Anna to worry, to plead, but there were no deities who would save them, no miracles waiting to happen.

Ice blossomed from the center of her chest, as though flowering from her heart. It began as a snowflake pattern that spidered across her torso, and then the edges started their inexorable spread. Slowly, the frost crept outwards, to her legs, her arms, before finally beginning its ascension up her neck. There was no more time. Anna felt the cold leave her body and be drawn through the barrier holding her back, to the Mirror and to Elsa. Elsa would never smile again, never laugh again, never be there to hold her again.

Anna still had so many things she wanted to say.

Elsa had closed her eyes, spreading her arms wide in invitation for the magic which sought a host. There was a haunting beauty about the figure she portrayed. She _was_ beautiful, an immortal figure cut from ice. She did not appear imprisoned, but rather, garbed in the crystal, released from the earthly tethers of mortality and perfected. It was more than physical, too. There was a dignity there which outstripped any of the simple pride she might have gained from the power she wielded. Elsa had chosen sacrifice. She had devoted herself to this act of nobility, and she was now very much like those heroes that Anna had read about and dreaming of meeting, those heroines that Anna had admired.

Anna no longer wished for any of that. She only wished that Elsa could be someone who wouldn't be burdened anymore. She only wished that Elsa could return, live her life and be happy.

"Please," Anna breathed.

And then she saw him.

Edmund was on the other side of the wall. He raised his arm, hand blazing with dark fire. Before Anna could do anything – to shout for him to stop, to make even the slightest motion in his direction, to even begin to wonder what he could possibly be thinking – he flung the flames ahead.

It struck the Mirror.

And on the pristine surface appeared a hairline fracture.

It had once emitted harsh, unyielding white light. Now where the fracture ripped across the Mirror, there was exposed not glass but an abyss that lay within, a maw of complete blackness. All its magic was drawn back into the fracture, peeling away from the world and cast into the heavy gales which swept into the vacuum of the Mirror. Everything born of its power winked out of existence. Even the terrible white light was swallowed within the darkness.

Anna hardly dared to believe.

Elsa was released from her prison.

Gossamer crystal rippled and receded as the ice began to withdraw into her heart. Her barrier collapsed, siphoned by the Mirror, and was drawn away into the void. Anna raced past the falling shards even before they fully vanished, shielding her face with her arm as she ran through the jagged crystals.

She caught Elsa before she fell. Anna held her tight, felt Elsa squeeze back just as strongly, just as desperately. She never wanted to let go again.

"Don't you ever try to sacrifice yourself for me," Anna said, sobbing into her shoulder but happy, happier than she had ever been. "Please, Elsa. Never do that to me again."

Elsa kissed the top of her head and murmured, "I love you, Anna."

After one moment of eternity, the Mirror shattered.

Its pieces scattered into the wind.

Winter receded. Snow thawed, and the sun peeked out from behind the cover of white that had so long obscured its radiance. Anna felt the rays of the sun warm her skin. When they looked out, Anna and Elsa could see into the distance where there was the slightest glimpse of the sea. Sunlight reflected off its waters and set the ocean aflame with twilight, filling the black-and-white world with the vibrancy of color.

It was a beautiful sight.

Anna breathed deeply, trying to make sense of everything that had happened, trying to understand this miracle. Elsa came to the same realization at the same moment.

They looked towards Edmund.

"Thank you," Elsa said.

"Do not…ever...thank me."

His voice was free of the pain which had plagued him for so long, but Anna could see that it was too late. Already his eyes were fogging, his breathing slowing to nothing. His heart had already withered away. Where his heart had been locked away at Baaj, nothing remained now but dust. But Edmund…had broken the Mirror. And the trolls had said…

_You really…managed to let go._

"In the end, I still won," Edmund said, but there was no spite, no malice, only an age-old weariness. Anna thought she saw a tinge of regret, when their eyes met, but she could not suffer his gaze for long and soon looked away. "I already died long ago...that day on Baaj. I head now into the darkness, while you must stay and suffer this cruel world. You are my legacy, Elsa. Prove me…wrong."

Elsa nodded.

"I will."

Edmund tilted his head back as though sleeping, closed his eyes; and he died, still, and always, Edmund.

**a/n:** Thank you all, so much. Epilogue to follow.
