**Chapter 10: In the Depths of Winter**

Anna set off before her courage could leave her.

After throwing on her cloak and taking one last glance at Elsa, Anna left the room and shut the door with a quiet click. She knew her way around well enough she could have traversed the castle blind, and with single-minded focus she sped through the dark halls.

Back at the main hall, Anna scaled the spiraling staircase built into the wall and stepped off to the upper level, then through the doors to the balcony. As if to deter her path, the blizzard raged strong tonight, enough to chill through her cloak and make Anna feel like she would be blown away any moment. She forged on. At the other end of the balcony lay a narrow corridor, and the longer she walked through it, the more the stone transitioned to ice, until eventually Anna felt like she was walking through a glacier.

Then out of the ice rose a staircase, glowing ethereal blue and sparkling with light all along its length.

"I can do this," Anna muttered.

She took the first step with bated breath, half-expecting to be struck down. Nothing happened. Swallowing and feeling the air thin, Anna ascended the staircase. Every step upwards was harder than the last, like an invisible hand pressed down on her back, until Anna was forced to steady herself by gripping the railing. Immediately, the pressure lifted. With a musical hum, _something_ in the ice responded and granted her passage.

Anna had no idea why, but she wasn't about to question a stroke of good luck. She spared no more time and dashed up the rest of the stairs, taking one, then two, then three at a time, her heart pounding in her chest and anticipation building in the pit of her stomach. She at last came to a door, and she knew this was _the_ door she was looking for, because it was locked. Not just locked. There was no doorknob, no handle, no visible means of opening at all, only a perfectly smooth pane of ice engraved with a snowflake insignia spidering across the surface.

Carefully, Anna placed her hand against it.

And the ice deconstructed itself. Anna drew back with a gasp as the snowflake pattern spun, and with each revolution the ice looked to be drawn into its core, until finally the entire door disappeared and the snowflake itself burst into infinitesimal particles scattering into the air. Nothing else impeded her path.

She stepped through.

And saw herself staring back.

When Anna flinched, the other Anna did the same. It was only a reflection. She had entered an unassuming circular chamber, with floor, walls, and ceiling hewn from featureless gray stone, and on the other end of the room was a mirror. Trying and failing to control her increasingly heavy breathing, Anna edged closer. Not a mirror but a _broken_ one, with half or less slotted within a circular-frame stand, not all the fragments even joined. Strange silver runes were etched all around the obsidian circumference and even on the mirror itself, the markings looking to form a kaleidoscope.

Laid vertically at the base of the mirror was a black casket. As Anna walked closer, she began to see that the glossy exterior was only a casing for a tablet of ice. Electricity crackled over its length, currents flitting across at regular intervals. Anna couldn't see it clearly because of the wisps of fog it released, and only when she carefully leaned over did she realize–

It was not a tablet but a coffin.

Beneath the transparent ice lay a man.

Anna stumbled back with a muffled scream. When she hit the floor, her fingers brushed over ever more runes, and Anna vaguely realized the floor was not, in fact, featureless. Tiny grooves had been cut into the stone, so shallow as to be barely noticeable, and the moment her finger ran along the indentations…

Light burst from the tiny channel. It surged along the curves etched into the floor then leapt onto the lines on the walls, illuminating the countless arcs that came together at strange angles to complete the design. Anna rose to her feet and saw at last that she stood in some kind of runic circle with the mirror at its outer rim, and her eyes followed the light upwards. Centered in the ceiling was a chandelier blossoming outwards like a flower of ice.

"What's going on…?" Anna muttered.

As she watched, the chandelier lowered of its own accord until it hovered at eye level. Sharp edges retracted one by one, each blade sliding inwards, each serration folding back. What remained was a chandelier with its center hollowed out, leaving _something_ behind to glow so brightly Anna couldn't discern what it was.

She was in over her head. She had no idea what was going on anymore, but she'd come too far to just give up. Anna edged forward as the blue light dimmed. A single snowflake. Just like the mirror, it was marked with a kaleidoscope. Before her eyes it continuously replicated, fractaling upon itself again and again, infinitely, to form a transparent orb with that single snowflake flickering brightly in the center. It was a single unbroken piece that could fit in the palm of her hand, no seams, no edges, no flaws. It was pure and perfect.

And Anna could hear it.

A tendril of foreign thought touched her own, a vague consciousness that hovered between clarity and sleep; and Anna immediately knew, without a doubt, it was that orb. No. Not the orb. That was only a protective shell. It was…that strange snowflake. Except it wasn't really so strange after all. It felt familiar, too familiar, a mixture of unbridled power and comforting cold that Anna had grown to know intimately these past few weeks. Anna wasn't sure how it was even possible, but the moment she felt that whisper over her mind she knew.

"…_Elsa_?"

She had to make sure. Anna reached forward.

But the instant her fingers brushed over the icy surface, the globe released a pulse of force that threw her back. Anna widened her eyes in disbelief as it began spinning in frenetic rhythm, releasing a shrill, earsplitting hum as waves of white arced from its perimeter. Even if there were warning she was too close to avoid the bolt of ice headed straight for her.

It pierced through to her heart.

Anna fell to her knees as cold spread through her veins, not all at once but something persistent, trickling through her blood so she could never get it out. It was agony and loneliness and resignation all at once, emotions that were not hers but excruciatingly strong, emotions that had built and built, strained against their repression, and finally released. Anna could barely breathe. Tears flowed from her eyes without pause, until she thought she might black out and die from the phantom anguish.

And then footsteps.

"She really did it. She really made a reliquary."

With all of her effort, Anna turned her head. Tobias strode in, triumph and glee plain on his face as his eyes roved across the chamber. When he saw her, his lips curved into a wide smile.

"I have you to thank," Tobias breathed. "Without you, I wouldn't have made it this far."

"Wh-What are you trying to do?" Anna gasped. She tried to get up, to do anything, but she only collapsed onto the floor fighting for breath.

"Alvard was an idiot, trying to kill Elsa. Our kingdom would fall in days without her powers; Elsa is too valuable to lose," Tobias admitted. He looked to the orb, at the snowflake within, and his voice lowered into a throaty rasp. "But here are her powers, manifested in physical form. I'll claim it for myself, I'll inherit her power, and I'll be the one to rule."

"Her…powers?" With all of her strength, Anna crawled forward and clutched at his leg. She had to stop whatever he was planning. All of this was her fault…

Tobias frowned at her. "If you must know, I'll tell you what she did to herself. Even you must have noticed how unnatural Elsa is. Her body isn't sustained by food, or drink, or breath, but _this_. It's old magic, you know, carving out your heart. We call it a reliquary."

The snowflake.

It was…her heart…?

"She's not even human anymore," Tobias sneered, seemingly delighted by the horror that grew on Anna's face. "A reliquary is sacrifice meant to amplify magical power, but it destroys your emotions. You know what that means? That _thing_ you see there...is Elsa's frozen heart. She carved it out. For power."

"N-No. You're wrong," Anna whispered. Try as she might, the cold was spreading too fast. Her eyelids were so heavy her vision dimmed.

"…Hmm. Maybe," Tobias admitted, looking over to the coffin. "She's been using her reliquary to keep Father alive, I see. Well, that will be something I discontinue after I gain control over it. And even the Mirror is here. I really must thank you, Anna. You have given me everything I will ever need."

Tobias reached out for the reliquary.

Anna surrendered to the darkness and closed her eyes.

* * *

_Anna._

Elsa woke to the feeling of pain, true pain, lancing through where her heart had been. Anna was in danger. She could feel her reliquary pulsing wildly, and she knew Anna must know, now, what she had done to herself. But Elsa was too afraid for Anna's safety to even begin to worry about her reaction.

She threw the covers off and dropped to the floor, pushing her fingers into the carpet. They sank in without resistance and Elsa pulled a thick pillar of ice up to waist level, still connected to the ground. She leaned forward and shot off like an arrow, gripping the column tightly as it rippled through the ground and pushed her down the corridors at breakneck speed. Even the floor moved under her feet, turning to ice and propelling her down the hallway fast enough to make the wind whip around her hair.

Rounding the corners, Elsa's moving ice floor reached the staircase up to the balcony. There wasn't enough time. As soon as she was clear of the low ceiling of the hallway she bent her knees to absorb the impending shock. The ice burst upwards violently, sending Elsa flying up an entire level. As she reached the railing, she extended a hand and created another moving platform that rapidly carried her through the doors and then rippled across the balcony as she sprinted.

"Let me make it there in time," Elsa begged, not caring which of any higher power heard her, only that one _did_ and would spare Anna.

She jumped onto the crystalline staircase and urged it to take her up.

_Let me make it there in time._

_…Wait for me, Anna._

* * *

She woke to the warmth of sun.

Anna barely remembered what it was like to feel sunlight, real sunlight. Not the weak rays filtering through thick clouds but the sun of a bright summer day, and she even vaguely recognized the spongy field she was lying on to be a field of grass. It was so comfortable that Anna stretched out and relaxed for a long moment, until she realized something was very, very wrong. Why was there sun and grass? She opened her eyes and blinked against the blindingly strong light, marveling at the sun hanging in the sky unobscured by snow and hail. Was this even the Southern Isles?

Her thoughts were interrupted by a gentle call. "Elsa! Where are you?"

Anna sat up immediately. She was in the middle of a large garden belonging to a modest one-storied home, made of pale red stone and with a flattened roof, but she could care less about _where_ she was when her eyes fell on the little girl standing not far away. Only a few steps away, practically in arm's reach, stood…

"Elsa?" Anna murmured. She was so young, four or five at most. Her face still had yet to develop into the sculpted porcelain features she would later possess, instead rounded with baby fat. Her clothing was not the elegant dress of flowing ice, but a simple blue cloth of an ordinary commoner. But Anna would never mistake her for another person. She had the same pale blonde hair, the same ice-blue eyes, and even now she bore an unmistakable air of grace.

"Coming, Mamma! I'll be there in a minute!"

Anna gasped when she saw Elsa grin, her wide eyes sparkling with mischief. She was so _happy_. In all their days together, Anna had never once seen her smile like that. Elsa didn't spare her a second glance as though having a stranger in their garden was nothing strange, her lips forming a pout of concentration as she bent down to pick a few flowers. Anna tentatively reached out, but instead of patting Elsa on the shoulder, her hand passed right through.

"Whoa!" Anna jerked back, clutching her fingers closely to make sure they were still there. It was the strangest thing, seeing her hand half-disappeared.

Once Anna calmed, though, she tried again with the same result. Finally, she shifted to the side and poked her head right under Elsa's face, staring up into her eyes. Anna retreated quickly when Elsa passed through her to continue picking flowers.

"You can't see me…" Anna said aloud, and Elsa gave no indication of hearing. Anna simply sat there and watched as Elsa hummed a light melody. She imagined Elsa to have grown up unhappy, but then what was she seeing now? Was this a memory? Was this even real? She remembered the reliquary, and Tobias, and then darkness…

When Elsa was done, she bundled up the flowers and dashed back inside. Elsa acted like any other kid her age, Anna thought, and she couldn't stop from smiling. It reminded Anna of herself a little, and _that_ was a strange thought. She rose to her feet and followed, gingerly stepping through the open door and watching Elsa run to her mother and hug her knees. They looked alike, only the older woman had brown hair instead of platinum-blonde, but not even the father was blond. Elsa had his eyes though, the same shape and the same shade of blue; and later in life, his smile, the tiny one at the edge of the lips.

"Elsa, look how dirty your hands are," the woman chided softly, but she still rubbed at Elsa's palm with her own, uncaring of the dirt getting onto her instead. When she noticed her husband laugh, she smiled and shook her head. "Vagn, really, stop encouraging her."

"But Mamma, look what I made!" Elsa brandished the bouquet proudly and her father plucked it out of her hands with a fond smile, tousling her hair and chuckling when she squealed.

"Let her play, Elmira. As for you, Elsa, I'll make sure this goes in a vase," Vagn said. Anna noticed the array of flowers arranged all around the house, no doubt from Elsa's work. "Now go wash your hands and then we'll eat."

It was a happy scene. Elsa picked around her food and Elmira promised her dessert if she finished; Vagn told anecdotes that left Elsa giggling. Something as genuine as this couldn't be faked. Anna's smile grew wider and wider as she saw Elsa so unbelievably joyful, but the more she watched the more confused she became. This went against everything she knew. If this was her family, then those scars–

A swirling vortex of color and sound filled her mind, the entire world spinning so chaotically Anna barely kept on her feet. When the world reformed, Anna at first thought she was in a different place; except everything looked largely the same, only emptied, and her impression had come from the sudden cold. Frost lined the inside of the windows; Anna looked around for the only one who could have caused it. If these really were Elsa's memories, then she had to be here somewhere.

As if on cue, a door opened and Elsa came into the room. Anna had to calm her hammering heart as she took in her appearance. Just a little taller now, perhaps a year or two older, but for whatever reason she wore clothes that looked worn out, edges tattered and frayed and the color washing out.

Just then, a loud shout sounded across the room.

"Elsa! Get back in here right now!" Even Anna jumped, let alone Elsa. Could it be Vagn? He sounded so different, gentle voice now darkened by anger so that it was lower, guttural. Elsa ran over and opened the door at the other end of the room, which Anna recognized as the kitchen.

Anna followed and walked in to find Elsa's parents seated at the kitchen table, but one look at them and a shiver ran down her spine. They were identical to the ones she had seen before, and yet not; the same people, but their faces were hard and cruel and so different Anna barely recognized them as the loving parents from before. Elmira stared down with contempt; Vagn glared with undisguised hate. Anna cried out when she saw Elmira raise a hand and slap Elsa across the face, sending her crumpling to the ground as she held a small hand up to her cheek. It was already starting to bruise an ugly purple.

She rushed over to the fallen girl, absolutely furious to see Elsa trembling. Anna stared up with accusation though Elmira wouldn't see her. _What_ was going on?

"How many times do I have to tell you, Elsa? Do _not_ ever let other people see your powers!" Anna watched in horror as Elsa was ordered to get up, told to go to her room and that she would not be getting dinner that night. As Elsa ran from the kitchen with tears in her eyes, Anna whirled around to her parents. How could they do this? Just because Elsa was _different_?

She wished so badly she could cause physical harm to the couple sitting at the table.

The world spun again, and the mist cleared to reveal a small room with the windows barred. Anna saw a bed in the corner of the bare room, and on top sat Elsa, clutching her knees to herself and crying silently with her head down. She sat down next to the child and tentatively reached forward, to brush her hair, to wipe her tears away; but then Anna remembered she could do none of that. She was useless here. Anna lowered her hand slowly, unknowingly clenching it into a fist.

"Mamma, Pappa…" Elsa curled further into herself, finally releasing small sniffles. She was so small. Anna didn't understand how anyone could bear to mistreat her.

"Please don't cry," Anna whispered.

Just then the door was flung open, and both Anna and Elsa looked up.

Terror flit across Elsa's face and she immediately shrank as though on instinct, pressing her back against the wall as far as possible. "P-Pappa, I'm so sorry–"

"You did it again, didn't you?" Elsa shook her head furiously as Vagn stalked closer, but her denial only made him clench his teeth. "You're going to kill us all! What will we live on with the garden frozen?"

"I didn't mean it!" Elsa said.

Her father reached down and lifted Elsa by the collar of her shirt. Anna knew she couldn't do anything to stop him, but she still tried to tackle the man, tried to take Elsa away, but she fell through him and slammed onto the ground. A moment later, Vagn tossed Elsa like a rag doll so that she collapsed in a heap not far away. Anna got to her feet and looked over to see Vagn tower over her.

"Then I'll have to punish you."

"…No," Anna whispered, eyes widening with horror as the man drew a long whip. Elsa backed away, whimpering with fear, and Anna almost screamed. Why weren't Elsa's powers protecting her? They should have started up by now, Anna had seen it happen before, _so_ _why was this still happening–_

Anna felt an icy hand grip her heart when the whip lashed down.

"Stop it!" Anna screamed.

No one heard. Elsa cried out at a second lash and turned to protect her chest and stomach, but now it was her back being flayed. Anna fell to her knees as she watched, wanting desperately to close her eyes. But she had to bear through this. Anna couldn't just pretend nothing was happening, so she watched helplessly as Elsa was mercilessly beaten by the monster her father had become, as Elsa called out and begged for the pain to stop, promised that she would be good and never use her magic again.

"It's not magic," Vagn spat. "It's a _curse_, and it's made you a _monster_. Do you hear me?" Another lash, even harder than the last one, leaving yet another bloody furrow across Elsa's back. "Say it!"

"I – I'll h-hide – I'll hide my–" Elsa choked.

Part of Anna never wanted Elsa to think of herself that way. Another part of her just wanted the pain to end, so that Elsa wouldn't have to suffer anymore. "Please," Anna whispered.

"You'll hide your _what_?" Vagn asked.

Another whip and Elsa screamed, "I'll hide my curse!" Vagn finally left, throwing one last glare at Elsa and slamming the door shut. It locked behind him.

It hadn't even been a minute. Anna felt _herself_ shaking just looking at the wounds, and Elsa looked close to passing out, pale face sweating and eyes half-lidded. Her back was bleeding profusely from numerous welts, and Anna realized she was still too young, too vulnerable. Her powers were still too immature to heal her, and so the scars had remained, a reminder that would never go away.

Suddenly the memory stopped. Not like the last time, but abruptly, the scene playing out in front of her turning to black and white and fracturing before it spiraled into one indistinguishable pulp.

Anna felt the rush of vertigo again, and then the world steadied.

_Wait, what?_

Elsa was smiling happily at her parents as they watched her play in the garden. Their faces didn't have a hint of the violence they held in the past two memories; Anna saw the loving parents again, adoration clear in their eyes, only Elsa looked no younger compared to the last memory. What was going on…? A light breeze threw a bit of dust in her eye, and Anna blinked away a shadow.

And then the world froze, shadows and static flit across Anna's vision, and when she opened her eyes again, the same scene was occurring but very, very differently. A thin layer of frost coated the garden and Elsa was alone with a diminutive snowman, hugging it tightly as though it were a lifeline. Anna stepped closer and kneeled next to Elsa. A pang struck her chest when she noticed how thin Elsa was, too thin, so that her ratty clothing hung uncomfortably over her bony frame. Dark rings marred her eyes.

"What did they do to you?" Anna murmured.

"Happy birthday," Elsa whispered.

Anna froze.

"My only wish is for Mamma and Pappa to love me again," Elsa continued, unaware of Anna trying desperately to give her an embrace that wasn't from cold snow she had created herself. She deserved more than that. "I'll be good from now on, I really will…"

"You're not doing _anything_ wrong," Anna breathed.

Elsa whirled around when the door to her home opened and Elmira stormed out. Anna observed carefully. It was like two different people, the kindly mother she had first seen and the inhuman woman she saw now. Whatever thoughts she had were pushed aside when Elsa cried out, Elmira having caught her arm in a vice-grip.

"This is getting out of hand."

"I-I'm so sorry, I don't know how to stop it–"

"Then I'll stop it for you." Anna saw Elsa tear away and stand protectively over her snowman, but Elmira only slapped her aside and Elsa tumbled facedown into the snow. The snowman must have been Elsa's only comfort. When her mother destroyed it, Elsa scrambled to its remains and wept bitter tears. Blood from her split lip darkened the snow.

"How much longer do I have to watch this?" Anna murmured. It hurt. It hurt more than anything to watch Elsa be treated so horribly and yet be unable to help her.

And then the world paused, spun, colors blending into a single dark hue. Anna closed her eyes and waited for whatever horror she would be forced to witness next.

She heard crackling. Alarmed, Anna's eyes flew open. Her heart leapt in her throat when she saw Elsa being dragged towards a furnace, the fire just as tall as her and roaring in its intensity, white-hot flames spitting sparks; Elsa fought every step of the way, sobbing and screaming as Vagn and Elmira pushed her closer and closer.

"We'll fix you," Vagn spat.

"_Stop it!_"

Anna's scream fell on deaf ears. She could feel the heat as Elsa did, the desiccation and blistering pain that built every step she was forced to take. Before long, the orange glow was close enough to reflect over Elsa's face, casting a flickering light over her pallid visage. Even her tears had dried.

"Please, Mamma, Pappa–"

"It's for your own good," Elmira said.

She took Elsa's hand and forced it forward.

Anna couldn't take it anymore. She closed her eyes and flinched away, but nothing could block out the piercing sound of Elsa's shriek, the horrible smell of burning flesh. She almost threw up. After seconds that felt like an eternity, everything silenced. Anna kept her eyes shut, unwilling to see any more.

_Let me out, I don't want to see this anymore, I want to_ go.

"Hush. Hush, little one. You're safe now."

Anna only dared to look when she heard a different voice, rich and smooth like silk and cream. A man knelt next to Elsa, cradling her trembling form, but for the first time, someone else drew her attention. Lying broken on the ground, only a few feet away from Elsa, were her parents. Their eyes were glassy, mouths open in a silent scream as blood poured from wounds pierced all over their body.

"I-I killed them," Elsa whispered, her breath shuddering as she clutched at the man. Anna stilled at her confession, but it was only a knee-jerk reaction. After everything she had seen, she was only glad for Elsa's safety. "I didn't mean to, I was so afraid, and then I was angry, and I couldn't control the curse–"

"They were despicable trash," Markus spat, and Anna knew it was him because she recognized his face from the portraits she had seen even back in Arendelle. His was the face of a warlord, stern features sharply angular, thin lips pursed into a line and cheeks hollowed inwards, eyes burning with strength.

Elsa looked to her parents and then away, shaking even worse. "B-But it was my fault–"

"What you have is a gift." Markus took Elsa by the shoulders and looked her in the eye, frown deepening. "Always remember that, child. You possess not a curse but a gift. Never conceal it. As for _them_?" Markus glanced at Elsa's parents, his lip curling. "They were beneath you. After what they did, no one would blame you."

"What do I do now?" Elsa pleaded. She was desperate for any direction, Anna knew. Anna had seen that exact look before when Elsa was having her nightmare, vacant and haunted.

"…You are not alone."

Before their eyes, Markus lifted a hand and inky darkness wisped around his fingertips. Anna was shocked but Elsa was doubly so, eyes widening and lips parting with awe and relief. "Y-You're like me?"

"I was not born with power, as you were, and I cannot ever compare," Markus said. "But I learned just enough to accomplish small things, enough to guide you. Perhaps that is my calling. Perhaps that is what fate intended for me."

"To guide me?" Elsa asked.

"Come with me. I will protect you. I will teach you," Markus said. He stood and held out his hand, eyes softening. "What you have is a gift, Elsa. You should be glad to have the fortune of it, just as I am glad to have come across a gift such as you."

Anna watched with bated breath as Elsa spared a glance at her parents, and then closed her eyes. Elsa took a deep breath, and when she opened her eyes again, her decision was made.

Elsa took his hand.

**a/n:** I feel like an extended note is necessary for this chapter, because of the reliquary concept. Hopefully I explained it well enough, although there will be more on the actual process in the next chapter (along with the conclusion to the flashbacks in the next chapter, ending with the explanation of the Mirror). So yes, some people did guess it - Elsa froze her heart, and carved it out, thereby strengthening her powers to a level she can't even control but also losing her emotional capacity in the process. And there you have it, actual, _physical_ proof of her self-rejection and self-loathing. More on this in the next chapter. I chose to have her heart in the form of a snowflake, orbed in ice, which is more metaphorical than a literal heart because 1) that's sort of gross, and 2) love will thaw. Also, a bit of a hint: Note the similarities between Elsa's heart and the Mirror. Markus will _not_ tell you everything.
