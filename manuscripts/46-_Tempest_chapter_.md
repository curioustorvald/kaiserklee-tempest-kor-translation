**Chapter 46: The Tempest**

Elsa woke after an indeterminate amount of time.

She had hoped she would never wake up. Instead, torn from the comforting darkness of sleep, she was now confronted with the reality that nothing would be right again. All she could see was the memory of Anna with that unnatural smile pasted on her face, that bright gleam of malice lurking in her gaze. Elsa opened her eyes to escape that ugly recollection, and was greeted by the drab grey walls of the dungeons. She was going to die soon, and these four walls would be her grave.

She was not chained, or bound, or in any way encumbered behind the steel gates.

She was powerless now.

Everything felt completely and utterly wrong. Elsa had always possessed her powers. She had never known life without the comfort of her magic enwrapping her in its embrace. Until now, now that the gaping hole where her heart had once resided had left behind a vacuum that could never be filled. Never in her life had she ever felt so weak. She felt blind and deaf without her gift, worse than useless.

And she was so cold.

It was hunger that spread over her skin, painful craving for warmth that dominated her every sense. It felt like being stabbed with thousands of needles until everything faded away into foreboding numbness, and her body felt clumsy, stiff and useless, as though water had been pumped under her skin and dulled her every sensation. Elsa had never felt this way before. She had never been cold, never been so weak. Every inch of her body hurt, as though she were being torn apart, as though she were being unmade. It was a sickness that spread from the hole of her heart, counting down the seconds of her life.

Elsa looked up when she heard footsteps, each clack resounding through the stone halls like an approaching death. She was almost right. Anna walked down the steps to the dungeon, smiling when their eyes met. Only that sight could have roused Elsa from her spot. Pushing herself up on shaking arms, she wondered if she could reach through the bars of her prison and choke Edmund out of Anna.

"I'm sorry about the arrangements," Anna said, coming to a stop just out of reach. "Not quite up to snuff with the room you prepared for me back then, but–"

"Stop pretending that you're Anna," Elsa growled. "If you're going to kill me, then just do it already."

Elsa felt some small measure of satisfaction when the smile fell from her face.

"Edmund had planned to save you, but then…you killed Gustaf," Anna said. "So I'm going to have to do nothing. It's only a matter of time. Without your reliquary keeping you alive, you're going to die soon."

"_What?_"

Elsa recognized that voice. Saul rushed down the stairs, looking ready to attack Anna. He might have done it if Anna hadn't unleashed a taste of her magic. Only a fraction of a fraction, and the pressure of it was enough to steal both their breaths away. She couldn't see or hear anything beyond the paroxysm of pain. Once Anna released her hold, Elsa fell to the ground, spluttering for breath. Saul was no more dignified, red-faced as though blistered by cold.

"Y-You promised…"

"I promised you that for your services, you could have Elsa," Anna said. She crouched to tilt his head up by the chin, and she studied his face before flicking him aside. "But I never said for how long."

"You were _working_ for him?" Elsa asked.

Sudden strength overtook her limbs and she lunged forward, seized the bars in her grasp. They did not freeze. They did not break. Elsa snarled, only feeling her betrayal intensify when Saul nodded.

"Enjoy yourself," Anna said, and she tossed a key to Saul.

Anna ascended the stairs back to the castle, and the door slammed shut. Elsa was left there with Saul, both of them kneeling on the ground, separated only by the bars; but his head was bowed and hers was raised in defiance, his hands were slack and hers were clenching the bars with all her strength. She hardly knew what to say, or even how to _begin_ to express the depth of this betrayal by her first friend, her _only_ friend. She wanted to _laugh_, that everyone had deceived her so well.

"I trusted you," Elsa said.

Saul said nothing.

"I thought that out of everyone here, you were the one person who could be trusted," Elsa said, her voice building to a crescendo. "Even when you tried to separate me and Anna – I could understand that, I knew that you still cared about me in your own way – _but how can you explain this_? You betrayed me. All along, you were working for him, and I _trusted_ you."

She really did laugh aloud, shaking her head at her naivety. Just because of their past, she had trusted Saul. She should have known. She could see nothing of that boy anymore, and she had been stupid to try to find him within this man. Saul remained kneeling without a sound, and his silence provoked her rage once again. No, Saul didn't _deserve_ to be silent anymore.

"Aren't you going to say anything?" Elsa asked. "Don't you _always_ have something appropriate to say?"

"Nothing I could say would make this better now," Saul murmured.

"So you just won't say anything," Elsa said. As though responding to her fury, the pain that ravaged her body worsened, ripping through her mind. She doubled over and uttered a guttural moan, feeling blood run down her throat. "Just come in then! Since _that_ was what you want–"

"No!" Saul shook his head furiously. "No, I didn't want this, I didn't know this would happen, I-I had no choice! I _tried_ to tell you, but I was bound, I was always bound from the day I met him–"

"Then just kill me!" Elsa screamed.

It was unbearable. Blood trickled from her nose, smearing as she laughed the pain away.

"I can still beg him to save you," Saul said, reaching through the bars, but Elsa jerked away. "It doesn't have to be like this. You don't have to die, I can save you! Edmund can do anything now!"

"Run back to your master like a dog, then!"

Elsa backed away to the edge of her cell, muffling her moans behind her hand. Fragments of tremulous thoughts shuffled through her mind, one after another, until she couldn't tell where one thought ended and the other began. If she could have looked at herself, she would have seen her skin turning an ashen grey, her neck pulsing with swollen, discolored veins. Aches and stings lanced through her body. Her breath came in short, ragged gasps, and even the _need_ to breathe was painful. It was too much.

She _wanted_ to die.

"Elsa!" Saul inched closer to the bars, but she waved him away with a violent motion, the best she could manage. "Elsa, I can fix this. Just give me some time!"

"I don't want anything from you," Elsa said, but her voice left as a whimper only. "Leave me alone. Let me die in peace."

"Isn't there…anything I can do?"

"Bring Anna back to me," Elsa whispered.

She was going to die, but that would be a relief. She would be leaving Anna to suffer an even worse fate, worn and paraded about like a second skin, and the thought was horrifying. Elsa stared into nothing, feeling tears flow from her haunted, widened eyes, and she did nothing to stem them. Was Anna still alive within the prison of her body? Was there even any trace of Anna left? She wished she knew. She wished she could see the real Anna just one more time.

Saul's expression hardened, but nothing could hide the tremble in his lips.

"Then I can't do anything after all."

Elsa slumped against the wall, uncaring that he left her behind.

* * *

Always Anna.

Halfway up the flight of stairs leading back into the castle, Saul stopped and slammed his fist into the wall. His gloves tore at the knuckles, and his skin broke against the stone, but he couldn't feel the pain. Part of him wanted to just collapse with the weight of all that had happened, this nightmare that had overtaken his reality. He was little more than a discarded puppet kept around for amusement, and Elsa was wasting away to her death. None of this was what he imagined. He had played the game, and lost.

There was nothing left to do but accept reality.

Saul prepared himself to put on his usual thespian performance, anything that would let him live. He had no illusions about his worth. Edmund could kill every single one of them, and he still had no idea what the madman wanted. Best to simply give in for now, and play along, live another day.

When his hand settled over the doorknob, the door pushed itself open from the other side. Saul had not been expecting the intrusion. Nobody visited the dungeons, not when there were never prisoners to be guarded. He stumbled back, reeling from the sudden push, but…

It was the sight of a _snowman_ that really threw him for a loss.

"What…?"

"Hi, I'm Olaf!"

Giggling, the snowman walked in and shut the door behind him. Saul observed every movement with fascination, and outside the incredulity of what his eyes saw, his mind was already hard at work analyzing the bend of the twig-arms, the span of his walk. It couldn't have been real. Saul reflexively stepped back as the snowman approached, flinching away when it raised an arm. It was only waving at him. Olaf lowered his arm when Saul did not respond.

"Well, that's rude."

"But this isn't possible…you…you are…a snowman," Saul breathed, and at once, a horrible idea came to his mind. "Did Edmund send you here?"

"No!" Olaf cried, and the sheer indignation in his voice convinced Saul that he was not lying. "Elsa built me. And we have to save her now! Come on! We need to bust her out of here!"

Olaf grabbed his sleeve, but Saul tore himself free, moving up the stairs again so he could leave all this behind him. "I never agreed to anything," Saul said.

"Don't you _want_ to help her, though?"

Yes, that was never even a question, because this was Elsa.

No, there was no point, because it was never about him.

"I don't know," Saul snarled, glaring down at the snowman clutching his leg, and the easy innocence in his eyes only infuriated him. It should have been as easy a decision as the snowman made it out to be.

Always Anna.

Saul clenched his jaw at the thought. Even now, moments before her inevitable death, Elsa could only think of Anna. But it was Anna who had destroyed everything. If Anna had never appeared, none of this would have been possible. Forget Edmund. It was _Anna_ who now ruled the kingdom, _Anna_ who now threatened her life, and Elsa still thought of her only. Elsa should have seen this coming. No good could have come from her involvement with Anna, and she had to have known.

None of this was his fault.

It could not be his fault, and for just a moment, Saul considered leaving Elsa to her death.

"Weren't you two friends?" Olaf asked quietly.

With that painful reminder of the past, the moment passed. Saul breathed deeply, eyes closing against his will, and he remembered the girl he had first met thirteen years ago. Elsa, having nothing else left in the world, had been so different from anyone he had ever known. If Saul tried hard enough, he could still see her eyes, unguarded and widened with awe. They had been friends. It was so long ago now, but they _had_ been friends, real friends. Not the shaky alliance they had settled into but unreserved friendship. Then, he would have done anything for her.

Even now, she had…trusted him.

"But I can't take her from here," Saul murmured.

"Why not?" Olaf exclaimed.

"Never mind that this could be a trick," Saul said, uncaring that arguing with a _snowman_ was insane. "It won't be _saving_ her to do that. We have nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Edmund would kill us all."

"But do you have any other plan?"

There was no choice but to go to Edmund. He could still set things right; Elsa could still be saved as long as he begged Edmund. Or Anna, as Edmund now liked to call himself while encased in her body, and the thought that he would need to bow and scrape to something that even looked like Anna was revolting.

Maybe the disgust showed on his face, because even the snowman could guess at his thoughts.

"You _know_ that he won't help her no matter what you do," Olaf said. When Saul moved towards the door again, he backed up and pressed himself against the metal frame. "Are you even listening to me?"

"It's still something that I can try!"

Saul seized the snowman and flung him back, hearing him tumble down the stairs. He didn't have any more time to waste on strange aberrations. Once more he placed his hand on the doorknob, but before he could twist it, he was interrupted again. It was a voice from behind. Not the snowman anymore.

It was a voice he had not heard in years and years, one that he had heard mature and harshen over the years into a queenly timbre.

"Didn't you say that you could be selfless for me?"

Saul turned, his hands shaking, but he could never refuse the person who had been his closest friend.

* * *

Elsa was surprised to hear footsteps again so soon.

She was even more surprised to see Saul return, accompanied by –

"Olaf?" Elsa whispered.

Saul and Olaf stopped at her cell, and Elsa spared only one incredulous glance towards the prince before returning her gaze to the impossible sight of the snowman.

"You built me," Olaf said, and the fact that he had a voice, that he could speak at all, stunned Elsa into open-mouthed disbelief. "Remember that?"

She remembered. She remembered building him as a child, but she also could never forget building him with Anna. She remembered their combined effort shaping the snow into his form, her magic forming the twigs and coal that adorned his body. But he had never been sentient. Olaf had never walked, had never possessed that bright gleam of intelligence in his eyes. Elsa had never created _anything_ sentient. Mindless monsters constructed out of snow, but those had no personality, only acted on fixed command.

"How is this…possible?" Elsa asked.

"Lots of things are possible if you just let yourself believe," Olaf said, and despite the cheer in his voice, there was an edge there, chiding. His smile fell, and he sounded distinctly _different_ when he asked, "Do you recognize me?"

"I-I already said I remember building you," Elsa said.

But she had the feeling that wasn't what the snowman meant, though the somberness that overtook him vanished and his silly smile took its place. She recognized him in another way. She couldn't help but feel an odd familiarity when looking at him, some spark of recognition, and even the ache of her heart faded away, partly, in his presence. It was an intimacy that went far beyond the snow and the magic that bound his physical form.

Elsa looked at him, and trusted him far more than she should.

She just _knew_ that he was unconditionally, unreservedly on her side.

"I can't get this door open," Saul said, and Elsa looked up to see him fumbling with the latched bolt before cursing as she had never heard before. "Edmund gave me a fake key."

"Here! Let me try," Olaf said, reaching up to the lock.

While Olaf struggled to unlock the cell, Elsa was left to stare at Saul. After her outburst earlier, she hardly knew what to say. She had been angry, betrayed, and that was still justified; but here he was, risking his life to save hers. She would have expected this sort of heroic behavior from him years ago. Not now. Not from the person he had become, the survivor and the politician.

"You…don't have to do this," Elsa said.

"…No, I think I do." Saul dragged his hand through his hair and exhaled a deep breath. "I'm sorry. I know nothing I say will make up for what I've done, but – I am truly sorry."

"Got it!"

Elsa was saved from responding when Olaf pulled his nose out of the lock, and the door swung open. Saul entered the cell and picked her up into his arms, giving her an apologetic nod. She was…grateful. She couldn't have gone far without assistance.

"You know this is pointless," Elsa murmured. "I'm going to die soon anyway."

"I don't care, I'm not letting you die in the dungeons," Saul said harshly.

"Maybe you can still be saved," Olaf said, ushering them along, and Saul followed right behind him until they were ascending the staircase. "As long as you're still alive, you still have hope, right?"

"We need to get out of the Southern Isles," Saul said. "Someplace warm, before you freeze to death."

Inside the castle again, Elsa relished the warmth that flooded her body. She wanted to just stay here where there were braziers and furnaces, but she knew that was impossible. She would need to brave the cold again soon enough. Even still, she tried to hold on to as much of the heat as possible.

Saul moved hurriedly, his long strides jarring her every now and then, and Elsa eventually succumbed to the temptation of just laying her head on his chest. Despite everything, he was warm. Saul paused briefly, but he said nothing and continued on. Elsa closed her eyes and breathed, listening to his heartbeat. Minutes passed like that. She barely noticed when they exited the castle.

"What are we doing here?" Olaf exclaimed.

"We need a horse," Saul said.

Elsa opened her eyes when Saul eased her onto the back of a chestnut horse. Saul sat behind her and grasped the reins, barely waiting for Olaf to clamber up to the horse's rear. She recognized him – Sitron.

"Hans won't mind," Saul said, and Elsa felt her lips twitch, just a little.

Saul kicked once, and Sitron broke into a furious gallop. They charged through the courtyards like the winter wind, leaping over the ruined gates in only a minute, and Sitron recovered as soon as he hit the ground, continuing his backbreaking pace as though he understood the urgency. Saul kept his arms wrapped tightly around her so she would not fall, but each time the horse bound through the air, Elsa felt the cold strike her skin and the chill seep into her bones. She clutched her hands to her chest, concentrating on just staying awake. If she closed her eyes, she wasn't sure she would open them again.

"I'm sorry I pushed you away," Elsa said.

Saul glanced down before returning his gaze to the snow-covered path.

"It's not your fault that I wasn't the one for you," Saul said.

"Maybe I could have given you a chance…and given myself a chance."

"Don't start doubting yourself just because you want to say goodbye," Saul said. "You were right that last time. You _did_ give me a chance, and I failed."

Elsa laughed quietly, and she said nothing more the rest of the way.

Saul stopped at the docks, pulling back on the reins so suddenly that Sitron reared and kicked before finding his balance. Jumping off without ceremony, Saul slid Elsa off the saddle and slapped Sitron once on his rump, giving the horse permission to leave. Olaf scrambled down, yelling, just before Sitron tore his way back to the castle.

"Oh! Are we taking one of those?" Olaf asked, pointing to the hulking steamboats.

"We'd need a crew to operate the ironclads," Saul said, and Elsa steadied herself on her own two feet while he ran to the smaller sailboats. Not bothering to untie it at all, he simply cut the ropes apart.

All the ice had been warped by the power of the Mirror's activation, and not enough time had passed for the ocean to freeze again. It just might work. Elsa hobbled onto the loading ramp, nodding when Saul moved to brace her steps and Olaf did his best to support her from behind. She barely made it to the deck, and she gratefully slumped against the side of the ship.

"Go inside," Saul said, pulling the running rigging to lower the sails. Immediately, he turned the ship port, and Elsa could remember him teaching her about all these procedures.

"No," Elsa said, ignoring Olaf's requests for her to do the same. She craned her neck to look back at the castle. "I want to remember this. I have to remember that..."

_I'm coming back._

_I will come back and save you, Anna._

Saul said nothing, continuing to trim the jib sheets and mainsail, and before long the sails were hoisted. They were picked up by the wind. As the ship set sail, Elsa watched the castle grow smaller in the distance, the place that had been her home and then her domain, and finally her prison. It had been her prison all along, though she did not realize. She remembered, now, her conversation with Gustaf that had taken place what seemed like a lifetime ago. She remembered him telling her that recognizing the prison was freedom in itself, and she wondered if he had ever been free.

It must have been terrible torture watching his son grow mad. No wonder he had tried to help her too.

She reminded him of Edmund.

It was then that lightning ripped across the sky, and the crack of thunder jarred her from her thoughts.

"What?"

Elsa looked up to the heavens, and what little hope she had left was crushed to nothing.

Stormclouds abruptly obscured what little sun remained, as though someone had drawn a dark curtain over the sky. A drop of rain hit her cheek, foreshadowing the sudden deluge that followed yet another ponderous thunderclap, a torrential downpour that hid everything from sight. She could see water and nothing else. Elsa was soaked through in an instant, the rain matting her hair to her face and weighing her down. Through the pellets of rainwater and hail that struck with violent, bruising force, she could only hear Saul yelling incoherent words. Gales battered them from all sides, teasing the sea into surging waves that struck the hull of the ship and sent them careening into the storm.

It was wholly unnatural.

Suddenly Elsa saw something very different from the scene before her eyes. Her chest ached and she grasped the spot, gasping aloud when her sight took her to the top of the tower above the Southern Isles Castle. Anna was looking out to the sea, tracking their every move. Her lip curled. Her eyes alight with terrible glee, she stretched out her arms and began to dance. She conducted the storm, her hands the lightning and her feet the waters, every pivot of her heel another surging wave and every slash of her fingers another striking thunderbolt. Elsa was so little, only an ineffectual blip upon the infinite sea, and Anna was the descent of divine might.

"Elsa!" Saul shook her by the shoulders, and only then did her vision settle. She could barely see him until another flash of lightning illuminated the darkened heavens. "Are you all right?"

"I-I'm fine," Elsa said, but she was not and she doubted they would be. Even now, the ship seemed ready to capsize at any moment. "It's Edmund creating this storm, I saw–"

"It doesn't matter now," Saul said. "I'll try my best to get us out of this, but you have to keep yourself safe! Olaf! Look after her the best you can!"

Olaf slid across the deck, where water was already beginning to spill over from the waves. Every time the waves slammed into their side, the ship rocked precariously, groaning from the strain as it rebalanced. Elsa grabbed onto Olaf, holding him close before the tremors could fling them apart.

"We're gonna get through this," Olaf said, but Elsa did not respond.

Lightning struck the sea just meters away from where they were, the blinding flash leaving white spots in her vision – and then the energy radiated outwards, the static washing over her skin and throwing both Elsa and Olaf to the other side of the ship. She struck the edge and nearly fainted on the spot, feeling electricity course its way through her body. Somewhere past her horror, Elsa marveled at the sheer power that Edmund – Anna – wielded now. It wasn't a coincidence that lightning struck so close. She had created this storm, and was actually directing the lightning. She was the goddess of the storm.

Anna _was_ the tempest.

Her wild laughter could be heard with the winds. Elsa felt the buffeting gales threaten to tear her apart but she held on to the edge of the ship, even as Anna poured more and more magic into the storm. There was a dull roar from behind; Elsa looked back, and her mouth opened in horrified awe at the fifteen-foot wave surging towards them.

"We have to get away!" Elsa screamed, but she didn't know if Saul could even hear her words.

They made _some_ distance, though perhaps from the efforts of the sea rather than by choice; but the tidal wave could not be avoided, and as the water rolled over her head, Elsa shut her eyes.

"We're gonna be okay!" Olaf yelled, and then all sound was drowned out.

Water slammed over the ship, and for a moment Elsa thought she might die, crushed under the sheer pressure. It was a choking blackness. Water flooded her mouth and throat, her eyes and ears, and her lungs seized. Elsa kept her hands wrapped tight on the edge, feeling herself begin to drift upwards with the wave, and then there was complete, utter panic once her fingers began to slip, one by one…

Elsa gasped once the wave had passed, and she could see and hear the storm once again.

"We made it!"

Miraculously, they had survived. She was drenched, but the adrenaline coursing through her veins didn't allow her to feel the cold seeping into her very bones. Lying comatose at her feet, Olaf was no longer responsive. Elsa wanted to fight, or perhaps to flee – but she could do neither, forced only to endure. How much longer would they be able to hold out?

There was just a brief respite.

Elsa saw another vision – Anna outstretched her arm towards the sky, licking her lips with a wicked, predatory smile. For a moment her hand simply hovered there, palm up, and Elsa waited with bated breath until – Anna clenched her hand and slashed down, and all hell broke loose.

Another flash as the sky seemed to rip apart, and this time the lightning struck the sails. Flames erupted over the linen and spread its way down the mast. Sparks flew from the inferno and lit anything unprotected by the downpour, and soon the smoke that billowed forth choked in her lungs. Elsa struggled to her feet, one hand clamped over her mouth. Fighting her way past the falling debris from the sails, the burning fragments of cloth that stung her skin, she started towards the bow.

"Saul!" Elsa screamed.

Saul turned from the steering wheel.

Elsa could see his ashen face, just as lightning struck between them.

It crushed through the hull of the ship, snapping through the wood as though it were rotten, and the blast sent Elsa flying back. For a moment, the ship seemed unaware of its peril. It stayed nearly intact for a moment more, until at last, with a protracted groan that was its death wail, the entire ship split apart. Wood splintered, revealing jagged, fragmented innards, and the two halves snapped, beginning to be dragged under by the churning waves.

Elsa shook her head to clear away the dizziness. She forced herself up, ignoring the groaning of the ship. Olaf was right behind her, but…

"Saul!"

On the other half of the ship, Saul was hanging onto the edge with only one hand.

Elsa scrambled to the edge, reaching out with her hand, but Saul was too far away. His arm only swung back uselessly to himself, and Elsa saw his hold slipping more and more.

"It's all right," Saul said.

"It's not all right!"

Elsa flung her hair out of her eyes and reached out again, stretching as far as she could. She could feel her arm almost pulling out of the socket with exertion, and it still wasn't enough. If she had her powers, she could have saved him. If she had her powers, none of this would have happened. Saul didn't bother reaching for her this time, and simply shook his head.

"You should be happy for me," Saul said, smiling.

Another wave struck, hiding him within its depths, and Elsa held her breath, hoping beyond hope that he would still be there. When the wave passed, Saul was still holding on; but his fingers were slipping. His hold was weakening, and even the wood on which he hung was beginning to snap apart.

"Elsa, I'm going to say this one more time, and I hope that I've earned the right. Forgive my arrogance, but I…I love you," Saul said, and when his smile widened, he never more resembled the boy that had been her best friend. "I'm glad I could be unselfish just this once."

"Don't say these things just because you want to say goodbye. You don't get to give up," Elsa said, but Saul had closed his eyes. "Not yet! You still owe me too much!"

"If we meet again in another life," Saul said, "I hope you can give me another chance. Anything left undone…I'll have to repay you then."

"Just wait–!"

Saul was swallowed by the roiling sea.

Lightning struck and, with a deafening roar that filled her senses, she, too, was sent adrift into the unknown.
